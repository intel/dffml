Operations
==========

Operations Implementations are subclasses of
:class:`dffml.df.base.OperationImplementation`, they are functions or classes
which could do anything, make HTTP requests, do inference, etc.

They don't necessarily have to be written in Python. Although DFFML isn't quite
to the point where it can use operations written in other languages yet, it's on
the roadmap.
