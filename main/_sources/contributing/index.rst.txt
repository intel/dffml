Contributing
============

Contributions can come in many forms, we always need help improving the
documentation. If you find issues with the documentation, usability, code, or
even a question, please open an
`issue <https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/new/choose>`_ to let us know and
or post in the `Gitter Chat <https://gitter.im/dffml/community>`_.
