https://github.com/intel/dffml/commit/8db01b0c59e6b70f36d3a16ea4428d803e272d06)

The guy who designed the logo for Git (https://jasonlong.me/) designed DFFML
a logo!!! We merged his contribution of the logo files yesterday.

One of the students from GSoC last year on the project reached out to him
and asked him if he would do it, and well, he did it!

For some reason the project getting a logo feels like some kind of milestone
in it's journey. I thought I'd take a moment to reflect on the project's
history, and update you all on what we hope is its future.

The project started on December 26th of 2017 when Diego Heath outlined the
original architecture. Building on John Whiteman's work and integrating with
Rodigo's web app, we set out on a mission to make a robot (George as Tibbs
named him) do our most dreaded of tasks, looking at open source projects!
We enabled auto review on the Allowlist Tool somewhere around June of 2018,
and the project open sourced on March 7th of 2019. We then presented the
work at [BSides PDX in October of 2019](https://gist.github.com/pdxjohnny/07b8c7b4a9e05579921aa3cc8aed4866#file-rolling_alice_progress_report_0003_down_the_dependency_rabbit_hole_bsides_portland_2019-md),
along with revamped data flow architecture which was inspired by the name
Jessica gave us, and with advice from Arjan. Just wanted to share with you
all since you all were a huge part of making the project happen. We couldn't
have done it without everyone's feedback and guidance thought the years.

Things have gone great the past few years being in Google Summer of Code
(GSoC). Big thanks to Terri who leads the Python Software Foundation (PSF)
GSoC org and helped us navigate that process and hosting us as a sub-org.
We've mentored 8 students, with several of those students having been mentors
themselves after their time as students. Most of the students have gone on
to have full time jobs, we're lucky that they still make time to be a part
of the community and mentor others. The project has been a space for students
to learn about software development and machine learning. The project has
also been a place for me to learn about running an open source project,
CI/CD, documentation, and most importantly building a community. I'm grateful
to all who have been involved as I know my learning curve was at times rocky.

Saying I'm a bit too busy lately is an understatement. The students who'd
mentored during GSoC the past few years are likely / hopefully soon going to
take over maintenance of the project going forward soon. Terri and I meet
with them and they have been working on their governance documentation
(thank you again Jessica) for their org: https://github.com/builtree.
Under their leadership, the project will hopefully reach it's beta milestone
within the next two years. I'm excited to see what the future holds. I know
they will continue the spirt of the community and build amazing things.

Thanks again for all the advice along the way.
