========================= origin/master news everyone! =========================


This is our first issue of the newsletter! What's the occasion? Lot's been
happing lately in the master branch. We're due for a release soon! The next
release will feature changes to the following areas:

- Sources
- Models
- Documentation


=================================== Sources ====================================


Labels for CSV sources were merged into master. Enabling users to save multiple
versions of datasets within the same CSV file.

Example:

$ cat > /tmp/dataset.csv << EOF
src_url,year,safe
Drinking Water,1000AD,0
Drinking Water,2000AD,1
Leaches,1000AD,1
Leaches,2000AD,0
EOF

$ dffml list repos -sources civ=csv -source-filename /tmp/dataset.csv \
    -source-labelcol year -source-label 2000AD
Undetermined (0.0% confidence) Drinking Water
safe                          1
Undetermined (0.0% confidence) Leaches
safe                          0

$ dffml list repos -sources civ=csv -source-filename /tmp/dataset.csv \
    -source-labelcol year -source-label 1000AD
Undetermined (0.0% confidence) Drinking Water
safe                          0
Undetermined (0.0% confidence) Leaches
safe                          1

Work continues on the MySQL and Hadoop Sources.


=================================== Models  ====================================


Machine Learning model packages from scratch and using the scikit machine
learning library (sklearn) have been merged into master. With these additions
developers will be able to use DFFML to make numerical predictions.

Example:

$ cat > dataset.csv << EOF
Years,Salary
1,40
2,50
3,60
4,70
5,80
EOF
$ dffml train \
    -model scratchslr \
    -model-features def:Years:int:1 \
    -model-predict Salary \
    -sources f=csv \
    -source-filename dataset.csv \
    -source-readonly \
    -log debug
$ dffml accuracy \
    -model scratchslr \
    -model-features def:Years:int:1 \
    -model-predict Salary \
    -sources f=csv \
    -source-filename dataset.csv \
    -source-readonly \
    -log debug
1.0
$ echo -e 'Years,Salary\n6,0\n' | \
  dffml predict all \
    -model scratchslr \
    -model-features def:Years:int:1 \
    -model-predict Salary \
    -sources f=csv \
    -source-filename /dev/stdin \
    -source-readonly \
    -log debug
[
    {
        "extra": {},
        "features": {
            "Salary": 0,
            "Years": 6
        },
        "last_updated": "2019-07-19T09:46:45Z",
        "prediction": {
            "confidence": 1.0,
            "value": 90.0
        },
        "src_url": "0"
    }
]


================================== HTTP API ====================================


An HTTP API for DFFML has been written to allow users to do all the things they
could with the command line interface and library. This will pave the way for a
web UI allowing non-technical users to start doing machine learning!
