- `ConfigLoaders` class which loads config files from a file or directory to a dictionary.
### Changed
- CLI tests and integration tests derive from `AsyncExitStackTestCase`
- SciKit models now use the auto args and config methods.
### Fixed
- Correctly identify when functions decorated with `op` use `self` to reference
  the `OperationImplementationContext`.
- shouldi safety operation uses subprocess communicate method instead of stdin pipe writes.
- Negative values are correctly parsed when input via the command line.

## [0.3.1] - 2019-12-12
### Added
- Integration tests using the command line interface.
- `Operation` `run_dataflow` to run a dataflow and test for the same.
### Changed
- Features were moved from ModelContext to ModelConfig
- CI is now run via GitHub Actions
- CI testing script is now verbose
- args and config methods of all classes no longer require implementation.
  BaseConfigurable handles exporting of arguments and creation of config objects
  for each class based off of the CONFIG property of that class. The CONFIG
  property is a class which has been decorated with dffml.base.config to make it
  a dataclass.
- Speed up development service install of all plugins in development mode
- Speed up named plugin load times
### Fixed
- DataFlows with multiple possibilities for a source for an input, now correctly
  look through all possible sources instead of just the first one.
- DataFlow MemoryRedundancyCheckerContext was using all inputs in an input set
  and all their ancestors to check redundancy (a hold over from pre uid days).
  It now correctly only uses the inputs in the parameter set. This fixes a major
  performance issue.
- MySQL packaging issue.
- Develop service running one off operations correctly json-loads dict types.
- Operations with configs can be run via the development service
- JSON dumping numpy int\* and float\* caused crash on dump.
- CSV source always loads `src_urls` as strings.
### Removed
- CLI command `operations` removed in favor of `dataflow run`
- Duplicate dataflow diagram code from development service

- Async helper concurrently nocancel optional keyword argument which, if set is
  a set of tasks not to cancel when the concurrently execution loop completes.

  how to properly load and save repos under a given label.
- Test case for Merge CLI command
- Repo.feature method to select a single piece of feature data within a repo.
- Dev service to help with hacking on DFFML and to create models from templates
  in the skel/ directory.

  type of given classification options.
- util.cli CMD classes have their argparse description set to their docstring.
- util.cli CMD classes can specify the formatter class used in
  `argparse.ArgumentParser` via the `CLI_FORMATTER_CLASS` property.
- Skeleton for service creation was added
- Simple Linear Regression model from scratch
- Scikit Linear Regression model
- Community link in CONTRIBUTING.md.

  includes APIs for configuring and using Sources and Models.
- MySQL protocol source to work with data from a MySQL protocol compatible db
- shouldi example got a bandit operation which tells users not to install if
  there are more than 5 issues of high severity and confidence.
- dev service got the ability to run a single operation in a standalone fashion.
- About page to docs.
- Tensorflow DNNEstimator based regression model.
### Changed
- feature/codesec became it's own branch, binsec
- BaseOrchestratorContext `run_operations` strict is default to true. With
  strict as true errors will be raised and not just logged.
- MemoryInputNetworkContext got an `sadd` method which is shorthand for creating
  a MemoryInputSet with a StringInputSetContext.
- MemoryOrchestrator `basic_config` method takes list of operations and optional
  config for them.
- shouldi example uses updated `MemoryOrchestrator.basic_config` method and
  includes more explanation in comments.
- CSVSource allows for setting the Repo's `src_url` from a csv column
- util Entrypoint defines a new class for each loaded class and sets the
  `ENTRY_POINT_LABEL` parameter within the newly defined class.
- Tensorflow model removed usages of repo.classifications methods.
- Entrypoint prints traceback of loaded classes to standard error if they fail
  to load.
- Updated Tensorflow model README.md to match functionality of
  DNNClassifierModel.
- DNNClassifierModel no longer splits data for the user.
- Update `pip` in Dockerfile.
- Restructured documentation
- Ran `black` on whole codebase, including all submodules
- CI style check now checks whole codebase
- Merged HACKING.md into CONTRIBUTING.md
- shouldi example runs bandit now in addition to safety
- The way safety gets called
- Switched documentation to Read The Docs theme
- Models yield only a repo object instead of the value and confidence of the
  prediction as well. Models are not responsible for calling the predicted
  method on the repo. This will ease the process of making predict feature
  specific.
- Updated Tensorflow model README.md to include usage of regression model
### Fixed
- Docs get version from dffml.version.VERSION.
- FileSource zipfiles are wrapped with TextIOWrapper because CSVSource expects
  the underlying file object to return str instances rather than bytes.
- FileSourceTest inherits from SourceTest and is used to test json and csv
  sources.
- A temporary directory is used to replicate `mktemp -u` functionality so as to
  provide tests using a FileSource with a valid tempfile name.
- Labels for JSON sources
- Labels for CSV sources
- util.cli CMD's correcly set the description of subparsers instead of their
  help, they also accept the `CLI_FORMATTER_CLASS` property.
- CSV source now has `entrypoint` decoration
- JSON source now has `entrypoint` decoration
- Strict flag in df.memory is now on by default
- Dynamically created scikit models get config args correctly
- Renamed `DNNClassifierModelContext` first init arg from `config` to `features`
- BaseSource now has `base_entry_point` decoration
### Removed
- Repo objects are no longer classification specific. Their `classify`,
  `classified`, and `classification` methods were removed.

### Added
- Definition spec field to specify a class representative of key value pairs for
  definitions with primitives which are dictionaries
- Auto generation of documentation for operation implementations, models, and
  sources. Generated docs include information on configuration options and
  inputs and outputs for operation implementations.

  `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` after entering all the context's passed to it.

  writing a Python meta static analysis tool,
  [shouldi](https://pypi.org/project/shouldi/)
### Changed

  op.name instead of `ENTRY_POINT_ORIG_LABEL` and `ENTRY_POINT_NAME`.

- Feature skeleton project is now operations skeleton project
### Fixed

- Base Orchestrator `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods were moved to the
  Memory Orchestrator because they are specific to that config.
- Async helper `aenter_stack` uses `inspect.isfunction` so it will bind lambdas
