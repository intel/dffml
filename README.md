## Mission Statement

DFFML aims to be the easiest and most convenient way to use Machine Learning.

- It's an AutoML Python library, command line application, and HTTP service.

- You give it your data and tell it what kind of model you want to train. It
  creates a model for you.

- If you want finer grained control over the model, you can easily do so by
  implementing your own model plugin.

- We make it easy to use and deploy your models.

- We provide a directed graph concurrent execution environment with managed
  locking which we call DataFlows.

- DataFlows make it easy to generate datasets or modify existing datasets for
  rapid iteration on feature engineering.
