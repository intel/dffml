                                <p>This rubric is was developed during the 2020 proposal review period. Reviewing
                                    proposals is very challenging, we have lots of applicants that do great work and
                                    needed to find a way to quantify their contributions. We use this rubric to do
                                    so.</p>

                                    <p>Explains why each field was chosen for the rubric. Some fields are subjective,
                                        others are objective. Each mentor will fill out a copy of the rubric for the
                                        subjective portion of the rubric. One mentor will count up relevant statistics
                                        to fill out the objective portion of the rubric. Once all proposals have been
                                        reviewed, the mentors rubrics will be averaged for each proposal. And the final
                                        score will be calculated for each proposal by tallying up all the points in the
                                        averaged subjective rubrics and the objective rubric. The proposals will then
                                        be ranked from highest to lowest. Final scoring will happen two days before
                                        slot requests are due to give students the most time possible to get more
                                        contributions in, get better at debugging, show self direction, and engage with
                                        the community.</p>

                                        <p>The proposal should contain enough details for it to be clear that the student

                                            taken into account. If their proposal lacks detail on implementation of
                                            something similar to what theyâve already done several times, itâs not
                                            necessary that they re-explain in detail in the proposal, their contributions

                                        <p>Google expects students to spend 30+ hours a week working on their proposed
                                            project / the project they are contributing to (assuming theyâve completed
                                            their proposed project). Students vary in skill level. As such, mentors should
                                            take their interactions with students into account as well as previous work a
                                            student has completed to estimate if the student will be able to complete the
                                            outlined proposal in the allotted time. Mentors should also think about students
                                            previous work and how long it seemed like they spent working on previous pull
                                            requests to estimate how long each action item in the proposal will take the
                                            student. Using this estimate, mentors should respond in the rubric with their
                                            thoughts on how many hours a week they think the student will be spending
                                            working on their proposed project to complete it.</p>

                                            future GSoC applicants, and the project. We cannot effectively collaborate to
                                            build open source software if we donât talk to each other. The best outcome of
                                            GSoC is not only the completion of the studentâs project, but the student
                                            becoming a mentor for other students or new community members. A high score
                                            here shows active participation in the community and that the students actions
                                            show them trending towards becoming a mentor / maintainer in this organization
                                            or another someday.</p>

                                        <p>Every mentor should vote for one proposal which is their personal favorite.
                                            Each mentor has different aspects about the project (DFFML) that are important
                                            to them (maintainers of different subsystems, etc.). Since the mentors will be
                                            advising students, itâs important that they believe in the projects they are
                                            guiding. This is how they signal what they believe is important or cool.</p>

                                        <p>While itâs always okay to ask what to do, itâs better to look at the list of
                                            things to do and pick one. Open source projects put a lot of effort into
                                            project management and organization of work items so that everyone knows what
                                            the open bugs are on the project and what the planned enhancements are.
                                            Everything is done in public because anything is accessible to anyone on the
                                            internet and itâs important that we all stay on the same page to effectively
                                            collaborate. Self directed students follow contribution guidelines and
                                            communicate their intentions to work on issues within the posted issue rather
                                            than other channels of communication which donât allow others to see the status
                                            of whatâs being worked on. This keeps the community in sync so there is no
                                            duplication of work. In some projects (like DFFML) issues are labeled with the
                                            estimated amount of work they will take to complete. Students who take on
                                            larger issues will spend more time working on the problem on their own and less
                                            time with a mentor stepping them through what to do. This is a measure of the
                                            students resourcefulness and tenacity for solving difficult problems.</p>

                                        <p>The act of working on any problem, programming in particular, is an exercise in
                                            figuring out what should be done, what has been done, and whatâs the current
                                            problem that is keeping what has been done from being what should be done. This
                                            loop of fail, fix, repeat, is debugging. Students should be actively testing
                                            their contributions. When those tests fail they need to use critical thinking
                                            to determine if what theyâve done is working or not. If itâs not working they
                                            need to figure out what the next step would be in fixing it, and try that. If
                                            they canât figure it out, then they should ask for help. A student that asks
                                            for help any time there is an issue without trying to figure out what the issue
                                            is before asking for help is not putting in enough effort. In addition, tests
                                            have to pass in the continuous integration (CI) environment. If the test
                                            doesnât pass in CI, then the student should be performing the debugging process
                                            looking at whatâs wrong in the CI environment. They should not say that they
                                            donât know what is wrong because it works for them. Feigned ignorance of
                                            failing tests does not excuse their failure.</p>

                                        <p>Some open source projects (like DFFML) label issues with the estimated amount
                                            of work they will take to complete. Larger contributions, or those associated
                                            with larger issues, receive more points than smaller contributions. The goal
                                            here is to reward students who have put in more effort leading up to GSoC.
                                            Theyâve worked hard to learn about the project they wrote a proposal for,
                                            and have worked hard to make that project better.</p>
