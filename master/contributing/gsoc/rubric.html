<h1>Proposal Grading Rubric<a class="headerlink" href="#proposal-grading-rubric" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This rubric is was developed during the 2020 proposal review period. Reviewing
proposals is very challenging, we have lots of applicants that do great work and
needed to find a way to quantify their contributions. We use this rubric to do
so.</p>
<div class="section" id="grading-rubric">
<h2>Grading Rubric<a class="headerlink" href="#grading-rubric" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="Screenshot of grading rubric" src="../../_images/rubric-table.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="grading-rubric-explanation">
<h2>Grading Rubric Explanation<a class="headerlink" href="#grading-rubric-explanation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Explains why each field was chosen for the rubric. Some fields are subjective,
others are objective. Each mentor will fill out a copy of the rubric for the
subjective portion of the rubric. One mentor will count up relevant statistics
to fill out the objective portion of the rubric. Once all proposals have been
reviewed, the mentors rubrics will be averaged for each proposal. And the final
score will be calculated for each proposal by tallying up all the points in the
averaged subjective rubrics and the objective rubric. The proposals will then
be ranked from highest to lowest. Final scoring will happen two days before
slot requests are due to give students the most time possible to get more
contributions in, get better at debugging, show self direction, and engage with
the community.</p>
<div class="section" id="goals-in-proposal">
<h3>Goals in Proposal<a class="headerlink" href="#goals-in-proposal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The project proposed should have a clear value to the project’s community. A
high score here means if the project is selected (and subsequently completed),
users would clearly benefit from it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="completeness-of-proposal">
<h3>Completeness of Proposal<a class="headerlink" href="#completeness-of-proposal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The proposal should contain enough details for it to be clear that the student
knows how to complete the goals they’ve outlined. More detail beyond proving
they know the basics of what needs to be done is better. If a student proposed
something but was short on detail, their contributions to the project should be
taken into account. If their proposal lacks detail on implementation of
something similar to what they’ve already done several times, it’s not
necessary that they re-explain in detail in the proposal, their contributions
speak for themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="time-commitment">
<h3>Time Commitment<a class="headerlink" href="#time-commitment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Google expects students to spend 30+ hours a week working on their proposed
project / the project they are contributing to (assuming they’ve completed
their proposed project). Students vary in skill level. As such, mentors should
take their interactions with students into account as well as previous work a
student has completed to estimate if the student will be able to complete the
outlined proposal in the allotted time. Mentors should also think about students
previous work and how long it seemed like they spent working on previous pull
requests to estimate how long each action item in the proposal will take the
student. Using this estimate, mentors should respond in the rubric with their
thoughts on how many hours a week they think the student will be spending
working on their proposed project to complete it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="engagement-with-community">
<h3>Engagement with Community<a class="headerlink" href="#engagement-with-community" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Student engagement with the community is key to their success, the success of
future GSoC applicants, and the project. We cannot effectively collaborate to
build open source software if we don’t talk to each other. The best outcome of
GSoC is not only the completion of the student’s project, but the student
becoming a mentor for other students or new community members. A high score
here shows active participation in the community and that the students actions
show them trending towards becoming a mentor / maintainer in this organization
or another someday.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mentor-vote">
<h3>Mentor Vote<a class="headerlink" href="#mentor-vote" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Every mentor should vote for one proposal which is their personal favorite.
Each mentor has different aspects about the project (DFFML) that are important
to them (maintainers of different subsystems, etc.). Since the mentors will be
advising students, it’s important that they believe in the projects they are
guiding. This is how they signal what they believe is important or cool.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="self-directed">
<h3>Self Directed<a class="headerlink" href="#self-directed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While it’s always okay to ask what to do, it’s better to look at the list of
things to do and pick one. Open source projects put a lot of effort into
project management and organization of work items so that everyone knows what
the open bugs are on the project and what the planned enhancements are.
Everything is done in public because anything is accessible to anyone on the
internet and it’s important that we all stay on the same page to effectively
collaborate. Self directed students follow contribution guidelines and
communicate their intentions to work on issues within the posted issue rather
than other channels of communication which don’t allow others to see the status
of what’s being worked on. This keeps the community in sync so there is no
duplication of work. In some projects (like DFFML) issues are labeled with the
estimated amount of work they will take to complete. Students who take on
larger issues will spend more time working on the problem on their own and less
time with a mentor stepping them through what to do. This is a measure of the
students resourcefulness and tenacity for solving difficult problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debugging">
<h3>Debugging<a class="headerlink" href="#debugging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The act of working on any problem, programming in particular, is an exercise in
figuring out what should be done, what has been done, and what’s the current
problem that is keeping what has been done from being what should be done. This
loop of fail, fix, repeat, is debugging. Students should be actively testing
their contributions. When those tests fail they need to use critical thinking
to determine if what they’ve done is working or not. If it’s not working they
need to figure out what the next step would be in fixing it, and try that. If
they can’t figure it out, then they should ask for help. A student that asks
for help any time there is an issue without trying to figure out what the issue
is before asking for help is not putting in enough effort. In addition, tests
have to pass in the continuous integration (CI) environment. If the test
doesn’t pass in CI, then the student should be performing the debugging process
looking at what’s wrong in the CI environment. They should not say that they
don’t know what is wrong because it works for them. Feigned ignorance of
failing tests does not excuse their failure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contributions">
<h3>Contributions<a class="headerlink" href="#contributions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some open source projects (like DFFML) label issues with the estimated amount
of work they will take to complete. Larger contributions, or those associated
with larger issues, receive more points than smaller contributions. The goal
here is to reward students who have put in more effort leading up to GSoC.
They’ve worked hard to learn about the project they wrote a proposal for,
and have worked hard to make that project better.</p>
