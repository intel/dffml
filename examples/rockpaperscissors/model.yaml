    # As the `Linear` layer only accepts 1D Tensors (2D if we take into account the batch_size),
    # We need to change the shape of the incoming Tensor i.e. flatten it in this case, so we use
    # torch's `view` property which will change the incoming Tensor size to torch.Size([batch_size, 16*9*9]),
    # hence the '-1' for the value of batch_size to be inferred from the remaining dimensions which is the 
    # batch_size specified already in this case. It is good practice not to hard code the batch_size in the network
    # as we might want to change it in the future. This is what the Linear layer is fed as "in_features: 1296".
