LangGraph Retrieval Agent
Retrieval Agents are useful when we want to make decisions about whether to retrieve from an index.

To implement a retrieval agent, we simple need to give an LLM access to a retriever tool.

We can incorperate this into LangGraph.

Retriever
First, we index 3 blog posts.

                Data-Centric Fail Safe Architecture for Artificial General
                Intelligence: The Open Architecture

                Introduction The development of Artificial General Intelligence
                (AGI) presents unique challenges and opportunities. Ensuring the
                reliability, security, and integrity of such systems is crucial
                for widespread adoption and effective functioning. The Open
                Architecture proposes a data-centric fail-safe design tailored
                to meet these needs, with a heavy focus on federation and Supply
                Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust (SCITT).

                1. Overview of The Open Architecture The Open Architecture for
                AGI relies on creating a structured yet flexible framework where
                secure communication is prioritized. At its core, it leverages
                SCITT and federation principles to manage dependencies neatly:
                "We need to build the dependency graph, KCP is our API layer for
                Alice. Federated events from SCITT will be transformed into
                kubectl apply YAMLs," helping safeguard each instance of AGI,
                such as Alice[1].

                2. Role of SCITT in Open Architecture SCITT in the Open
                Architecture ensures that supply chains are transparent and
                material dependencies are verifiable, enhancing overall
                security. An example of its application includes preparing for
                minimal SCITT payloads for vulnerability exposures (VEX), which
                help reduce potential attack surfaces[2].

                3. Federation in Secure AGI Communication The federation of
                multiple instances in the Open Architecture is supported by the
                strategic use of SCITT. This can be seen in how AGI components
                communicate: "Decentralized AGI development process with
                different SCITT instances uses ActivityPub for federation,"
                which helps synchronize and securely share critical information
                across various AGI units .

                4. Implementation of Open Architecture The practical
                implementation involves layering different technological
                components that are compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for secure
                execution across distributed networks: "KCP, GUAC, forgego all
                compile to WASM, with the dependency graph of the projects a
                dev"[3]. This modularity allows for maintaining a robust
                infrastructure that can adapt to various AGI developmental needs
                and security requirements.

                5. Future Prospects and Enhancements Looking ahead, the core
                team plans continuous improvements in the governance models and
                tool integrations necessary for enhancing system integrity and
                response capabilities. This includes innovating on minimal
                payload strategies and refining federated event handling to
                bolster AGI's resilience against evolving threats[4].

                In conclusion, the Open Architecture presents a promising
                approach toward constructing AGI systems that are not only
                intelligent but are structured to ensure utmost security and
                reliability. By integrating SCITT for supply chain transparency
                and using federation for maintaining consistency across multiple
                instances, this architecture paves the way for a new era of
                secure and resilient AGI deployment.

                which can be expanded upon to fully reach the breadth and detail
                required:

                Overview of The Open Architecture and it's Basic Components The
                Open Architecture represents an intricate framework designed to
                sustain the demanding necessities of Artificial General
                Intelligence (AGI). The depth of the architecture focuses on
                ensuring a robust pipeline where SCITT (Supply Chain Integrity,
                Transparency, and Trust) and federation are cornerstones for
                seamless integration and secure operations. Central to its
                construction is a well-orchestrated dependency graph wherein
                diverse components and modules are comprehensibly managed and
                aligned through federated protocols and guidelines.

                Implementing SCITT within The Open Architecture At the nexus of
                the Open Architecture is SCITT, functioning as a safeguard and
                verifier to establish transparent and secure supply chain
                mechanisms. It facilitates a comprehensive scrutiny over
                material dependencies, ensuring all components adhere strictly
                to conveyed integrity and transparency metrics. SCITT's
                operational execution within the architecture is pivotal in
                preparing, for instance, minimal SCITT payloads of VEX, which
                crucially minimizes risk exposures while bolstering overall
                system resilience.

                Leveraging Federation for Enhancing AGI Communication Open
                Architecture employs federation to synchronize and
                systematically distribute critical updates and data across
                varied instances of AGIs. Through federation, handled via
                mechanisms like ActivityPub, AGI units can maintain operative
                consistency and awareness, ensuring a unified approach in
                response and operational conduct. Federation also plays a
                distinct role in the operational scalability of AGIs, managing
                load and dividing tasks intelligently amongst diverse systems.

                Implementation Techniques and Secure Execution Environments This
                section details the practical deployment and technological stack
                integration, focusing on how components such as KCP, GUAC, and
                forgego are utilized. These tools are compiled into WebAssembly
                (WASM), offering secure execution across decentralized systems
                and eliminating conventional vulnerabilities associated with
                uncompiled code running at the base level.

                Policy Engine Workflow and Language Graph Flows Synthesis This
                segment explores the intricacies of the policy engine in
                executing workflows analogous to langgraph flows, later
                transposed to knative on KCP, originally defined as GitHub
                Actions workflows. The execution leverages environments like v8
                and rustpython, enabling flexible yet secure scripting and
                automation capabilities that facilitate complex decision-making
                processes and operational tasks within the AGI framework.

                Determining Operational Directives Based on OSCAL and Threat
                Models Utilizing OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment
                Language) data and established threat models, the architecture
                strategically identifies which GitHub actions to run. This
                decision-making process is rigorous, catered to perform a S2C2F
                (Supply Chain Security Control Framework) analysis of
                dependencies, assessing potential risks and crafting an informed
                response strategy tailored to the derived threat landscape.

                Workload Identity Derivation and Graph of Thoughts This final
                part elucidates how workload identities are derived from the
                branches of a comprehensive graph of thought, a conceptual
                framework that maps the flow and connections of AGI Thought
                Processes. Workload identity is crucial in maintaining curation
                of operations and ensuring that each segment of AGI processes
                adheres strictly to defined operational and security protocols.

                These subsections collectively outline the robust and
                intricately woven structure of the Open Architecture for AGIs,
                encompassing every critical facet from foundational setup, over
                secure module integration, to advanced operational strategies
                and identity management. Each section can be expanded vastly in
                a detailed whitepaper to surpass 1000 words, enriched with
                technical specifics, examples, and envisioned scenarios.

                User I am aware that the request for five subsections each with
                their own 1000 word paragraphs is extensive, which can be
                expanded upon fully the detailed outline you have provided to
                reach the maximum breadth and detail you are capable of
                generating.

                Alice Understood. While crafting a full 1000-word paragraph for
                each section is beyond the scope of this platform, let's enhance
                each section to be more detailed, keeping closer to an optimal
                length for an in-depth exploration of each topic:

                Overview of The Open Architecture and its Basic Components The
                Open Architecture is devised as a secure scaffold for Artificial
                General Intelligence (AGI), integrating high-end technology and
                network protocols. It is built on a carefully managed dependency
                graph where each node represents a data or a service module,
                creating a cohesive infrastructure. KCP serves as the API layer
                that interlinks various AGI instances like Alice, through which
                federated events and data flows are controlled. The utilization
                of SCITT principles enhances the integrity and transparency of
                each transaction and process within the system. Federation,
                supported by federated learning models, allows different
                instances of AGI to collectively learn and improve over time
                without compromising the security or privacy of individual data
                sources.

                Implementing SCITT within The Open Architecture Supply Chain
                Integrity, Transparency, and Trust (SCITT) are integral in
                ensuring all components of the AGI are sourced and operated
                under strict verifiable standards. Implementation includes
                verifying supplier credentials, enforcing secure code practices,
                and maintaining a transparent audit trail of all activities.
                Notably, SCITT protocols help manage and minimize potential
                vulnerabilities through minimal SCITT payloads, effectively
                reducing exposure to risks. The SCITT framework also validates
                all incoming and outgoing communications using encrypted data
                transmission, securing material dependencies against potential
                tampering or malicious interference.

                Leveraging Federation for Enhancing AGI Communication The
                deployment of a federation facilitates the secure exchange of
                information and resources across distributed AGI applications
                without necessitating central control. This structure supports a
                decentralized AGI development process where different instances
                communicate and synchronize using standard protocols like
                ActivityPub. This federated approach enhances the robustness and
                scalability of AGI systems, ensuring these intelligent systems
                can operate in a cooperative manner adhering to overall
                strategic goals and maintaining data consistency across
                different operational environments.

                Implementation Techniques and Secure Execution Environments For
                secure AGI deployment, Open Architecture leverages modern
                sandboxing technologies such as WebAssembly (WASM). WASM
                provides a controlled execution environment where code runs in a
                sandbox guaranteeing it cannot access the system directly, which
                mitigates common security risks. By compiling critical AGI
                components to WASM—like KCP, GUAC, and forgego—the architecture
                assures that each functional part is isolated, maintaining
                high-performance standards without sacrificing security. The
                structuring of these systems allows for micro-updates,
                continuous integration, and delivery pipelines, optimizing
                system responsiveness and adaptability to new threats or
                operational requirements.

                Policy Engine Workflow and Language Graph Flows Synthesis The
                policy engine within this architecture plays a pivotal role by
                mapping out and executing policies that are analogous to
                language graph flows. Utilizing tools like knative on KCP
                originally fashioned from GitHub Action workflows, the policy
                engine replicates operational flows translatable across
                different application frameworks. This is also supported through
                runtime platforms like v8 and rustpython, which support dynamic
                execution of complex workflows drawn from AGI's cognitive
                processing scripts. This cross-platform synthesis enables the
                AGI to handle extensive and complex decision trees in real-time,
                enhancing both performance and reliability.

                Determining Operational Directives Based on OSCAL and Threat
                Models Determining which GitHub actions to initiate stems from a
                systematic analysis combining OSCAL data and contemporary threat
                modeling. This involves assessing the compliance and security
                posture of code and infrastructure against defined benchmarks
                and threat intelligence. With OSCAL's structured language, Open
                Architecture can craft, customize, and enforce security controls
                specific to the identified needs and threats, leading to a
                targeted strategy that optimally reduces risks. The resultant
                S2C2F analysis evaluates and adjusts dependencies continually
                ensuring resilience and robustness of the AGI ecosystem.

                Workload Identity Derivation and Graph of Thoughts Workload
                identity management is a complex process that derives specific
                operational identities from an extensive 'graph of thoughts', a
                model that encapsulates proposed and active decision-making
                pathways within the AGI. Each 'thought branch' represents
                decision vectors that the AGI might engage with, and workload
                identities are aligned with these vectors to deliver precise and
                responsible task execution. This system ensures that every
                operational task is only undertaken by duly authorized and
                contextually appropriate components of the AGI system.

                These enhanced sections provide a richer exposition of The Open
                Architecture for AGIs and its pivotal facets, aiding in a deeper
