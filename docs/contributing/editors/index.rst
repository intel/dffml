Setting Up Your Editor
======================

Maintaining proper execution of DFFML API both in development and deployment
levels is the top priority of the development team. DFFML modules are tightly
coupled; as a result, the debugging process can be complicated.
After identifying the potential problems or encountering an error during
execution time, developers need to reproduce the problem and also be able to
acquire knowledge about the program and state of the variables, specifically
a couple of steps before the problems. This requires setting up a debugging
environment. In this section, setting up a debugger for DFFML in different
editors is presented.
