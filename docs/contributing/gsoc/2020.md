# GSoC 2020

DFFML participated in Google Summer of Code under the Python Software Foundation
umbrella. You can read all about what this means at https://python-gsoc.org/

## Student Contributions

Huge thanks to our students of the 2020 GSoC program who made a huge impact on
DFFML's abilities, collection of models, and tutorials. As well as various bug
fixes.

## Thanks

Big thanks to [Terri](https://github.com/terriko) her work organizing GSoC and
letting us copy her format she used for
[CVE Binary Tool](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool), another awesome
project with a security focus that was a part of GSoC 2020 as well. Check them
out too!
