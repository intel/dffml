Setting Up Debugging Environment
================================

Maintaining proper execution of DFFML API both in development and deployment levels is the top priority of the development team. DFFML modules are tightly coupled; as a result, the debugging process can be complicated. 
After identifying the potential problems or encountering an error during execution time, developers need to reproduce the problem and also be able to acquire knowledge about the program and state of the variables, specifically a couple of steps before the problems. This requires setting up a debugging environment. In this section, setting up a debugger for DFFML in different editors is presented.
