=========

Miscellaneous questions can be asked on
`Gitter <https://gitter.im/dffml/community>`_ or in the
`GitHub Issue <https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/12>`_ meant for questions.

We hold weekly meetings on Tuesday's at 9 AM PST. Meetings are held via Google
Hangouts.

If you have questions about you might go about integrating machine learning, or
using data flow programming, hop on the meeting and we'll do Q & A at the end of
the agenda.

- `Meeting Minutes <https://docs.google.com/document/d/16u9Tev3O0CcUDe2nfikHmrO3Xnd4ASJ45myFgQLpvzM/>`_

The goal of DFFML is to build a community driven library of plugins for dataset
generation and model definition. So that we as developers and researchers can
quickly and easily plug and play various pieces of data with various model
implementations.

The more we build up the library of plugins (which anyone can maintain, they
don't have to be contributed upstream unless you want to) the more variations on
model implementations, feature data generators, and database backend
abstractions, we all have to work with.

If you have developed a plugin for DFFML and would like it listed in the docs,
please open an `issue <https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation&template=new_plugin.md&title=plugin%3A+new%3A+>`_.
