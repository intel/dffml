=========

Miscellaneous questions can be asked on
`Gitter <https://gitter.im/dffml/community>`_ or in the
`GitHub Issue <https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/12>`_ meant for questions.

We hold weekly meetings on Tuesday's at 9 AM PST. Meetings are held via Google
Hangouts.

If you have questions about you might go about integrating machine learning, or
using data flow programming, hop on the meeting and we'll do Q & A at the end of
the agenda.
