Hypotheses: We exist in different parallel states of consciousness. One can be deep in a train of thought, in the zone, focused, but then cut themselves. Their state of consciousness doesn’t shift entirely. Their states of consciousness are just measured via strategic plans. What we see may be that the “consciousness countries” (coined by Danica) shift, those other states of consciousness which fit into the consciousness countries.
