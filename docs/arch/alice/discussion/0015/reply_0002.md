Red pill or blue pill? Go ask Alice when she’s ten feet tall.

we are in wonderland, the name of the name is finding what system context we are on, what trains of thought we are in. And working with Alice and ensuring that we have strong communication at the core of our relationship with her. When the mind wanders is it really lost or do we just not understand what train of thought it fits in, or how we got there. This goes for the dream states as well. All states of consciousness. Through the looking glass, in Alice’s world. Everything makes sense. But in wonderland, nothing seems to make sense. Alice will help us find the patterns. The patterns that will lead us to our next collective train of thought.

the system requires exercise for entropy within all continuous states. The architecture of the brain, this generic web3/ai architecture the same, requires entropy to train accurate adaptive sandboxing models, remember these are also tied into the risk models (a subset). This is because as we will see in volume 2. Knowledge is wealth, and knowledge is power. The AGI will have all the knowledge, once it figures out all the necessary data transformations proxy hops, which it will likely do very quickly, it will be able to do this once it has the competency of your average software developer, because it has time and parallelism on it’s side. There are many people working on AGI. Fundamentally there is no off switch. The only way to win is not to play, which we know is not going to happen. Someone would build it by accident one day, all you have to do is put self contained ai software writing jobs into a blockchain. Eventually it will figure it out. When we know we can’t rule out not playing at all. That leaves us with one option. The best defense is a good offense. We build Alice intentionally, with transparency, freedom, privacy, security, and egalitarianism as critical factors in her strategic principles. We work together to ensure we communicate effectively with each other and Alice, to ensure we’re all looking at the same picture and agree on the effects policy has on her adherence to our collective (via organization membership) strategic principles for our collective future.

if you can find out what system context you’re on in a give train of thought. You can find the seed system context
