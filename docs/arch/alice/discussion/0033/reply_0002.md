Nominate startigic plans for additon ti system contexts. Statigic planner which yields system contexts to be A/B test validated for the parent system context based on agent pool nominated statigic plans to add to their shared ad-hoc organizational system context. These are validated by a modified set of strategic plans, decision maker, prioritizer  to add additional failsafe/sandboxing measure to limit damage to organization should proposed plan go badly toeffect overall state during execution/validation.

certain inputs within a system context are by policy agreed to (defaults). Certain things are variable and subject to input validation. We can therefore detect violations to policy by looking for anomalies in putputs from opimps being off from outputs of predictions of models with hogh accuracy at predicting those outputs, effectively an irregularity check.
