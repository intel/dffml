- the examples in the docstring become the possible integration options which become the suggested dataflows for overlay if the top level system context has those definitions (for example github user var in ci job from file). They could also be consumed by a strategic plan within the caller which looks for mitigations i.e. alternative integration overlay options aka different data transformations to link things up and treated as training data from a trustworthy source (allowing for multiple sources if varrying trust of course)
