- We’re enabling a two way sync between time. We can write any chain of system contexts. A two way sync of state across representations of state with integrated risk management.
  - Rolling Alice: Volume M: Time Travel With Us
  - Once Alice’s capabilities have matured we’ll write a sequel to the health of ecosystem volume where we extend the software ecosystem activities to terraforming
- Understand all the layers of the stack. Understand calling conventions within and between them as protocols. Represent via heterogeneous serialization format (web3)
- Its like SWIG but cross everything via always option to I/O to web3
- Alice, the AI, the entity, is what understands how to initiate communication with and work with any other entities under any organizational or other constraints to get a job done, to move strategic principals in desired direction. People who don’t speak the same language moving a couch. Communication requires context and may involve language but requires a shared agreement on “reality”
- We don’t always understand the reality on the other side of execution of a hybrid on/off chain contract. Which is why our cross domain conceptual mapping is critical to achieve equilibrium is critical. It’s what allow us to quickly hone in on how do strategic principles map from what we know reality is and experience it to what we think it should look like on the other side. This is like our allowlist tool categories. We can attempt to predict them by using unsupervised clustering models on the output of the extracted feature data. We then train automl with auto feature engineering models across
