Theres a supply chain for everything, even thoughts. Web3 helps us capture it. Alice helps us act on it. Tailor the way we treat our supply chain to match our assets and strategic principles. As well as identify opportunities for alignment with others so as to further mutual strategic plans which satisfy booth parties (killing 2 birds with one stone by working together). If we can identify a bird of equal value in the aggregate of all entities subscribing to this model of self governance, all trades can be made with no overhead. No conversation to a backing currency.
