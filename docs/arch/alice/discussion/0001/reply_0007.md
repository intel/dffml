Your software supply chain is like your supply chain of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu moves when you’re rolling. The way that Alice thinks is a software supply chain because it is a thought supply chain (running on the thought transportation layer, the commodity and the infrastructure, the entity is the addition of context, the three form the system context ⛪️). When you roll as you go from context to context you train up your skills, your internal models, gathering datapoints you understand what moves you need to drill, and what kind of moves you are going to do on different weight classes of opponents. This is the debug model, we’re learning on the fly. Strategy is looking across, tactics are how you execute. We treat everything in this model. Tactics used in one situation may effect strategies in another area. If by working to get an armbar you end up getting experience finishing with a triangle instead, or with software you pursue one train of thought of debugging in one repo and find that really the problem is with the overall architecture of a better option for a dependency you’d previously considered but then threw out maybe due to the need for a different filesystem driver a common case doing kernel development, this is the let me pull in a linux driver within my custom xen spin generated by the synthesis of the automated branch by abstraction.
