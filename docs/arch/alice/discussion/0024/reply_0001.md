value of data is defined as the datas relative weight when determining importance by a prioritizer. Different data has different value within different contexts as defined by each contexts prioritizer. Rewards for execution based on alignment with reward givers prioritizer output for a system context (agent, user, org). This means we can incentivize verbatim execution of trains of thought (attestation, etc.) Or we can incentivize agents who we see are doing activities which have strong correlation between our priorities. We see this using outputs of strategic plan models. Use WGs as an example.
