- Orchestrator allows for
  - Switching execution method easily
    - Run on my local machine to test
    - Run in kubernetes cluster
    - Run in Intel DevCloud for access to machines with ML hardware
  - Local development
    - Rapid iteration on CI jobs
    - No need to push repo to validate CI is working
    - Finally we can support running all tests locally
