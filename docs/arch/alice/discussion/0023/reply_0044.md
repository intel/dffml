  - OTP - erlang is a glorified supervision tree
    - Can hook into this to issue commands to erlang VMs, gives you fault tolerence

    - It can manage how it fails
    - Backpressure is watching the infinate stream and it's monitoring and watching and detecting if it's oversubscribing the resources available
    - People are using elixir with rust
    - We deploy an elixir app
      - We give a stream of data to the pipeline
      - The produce plucks the head of the stream for the processes downstrema to do their work and it will stich the data bcak togethere. I twill partiion the data in parallel and then 
      - If your process crashes, the supervision tree decides what to do (strategic plans)
        - Model in elixir is crash, then supervisers break down
  - Broadway is what is producing the events, flow is what
