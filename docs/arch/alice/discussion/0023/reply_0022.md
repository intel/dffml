- The Open Architecture enables hybrid on/off chain smart contacts.
  - It does this by incorporating risk management into architecture definition / smart contract.
    - Strategic plans work with the gatekeeper and prioritizer to negotiate and execute off chain contracts.
    - Models within strategic plans are involved in risk tolerance.
  - Smart contracts with understanding of risk are effectively entities making decisions based on models. This allows for mutation in implementation while maintaining principles.
    - The smart contract is able to make its own decisions based on learned experience (models) so as to continue to operate until its strategic goals are meet. As measured by oracle data ordained from trusted parties as is applicable to context. Where chains of trust are established via Peer DIDs between entities and data for provenance. Leveraging verifiable credentials (opencert) for review system to measure risk in absence of attestation.
- For trains of thought at critical velocity. Fully optimized resource utilization to optimally progress train of thought to move strategic principles in correct directions and advance the “state of the art” for any given conceptual field. A/B feature branch permutation testing to sus out bleeding edge to determine system context which is the optimal selection of overlays where overlays are forks, branches, similar repos, similar projects, similar specs, similar working groups, similar goals, similar strategic plans, similar strategic principles, priorities. Autoencoders trained against input data for system context with high accuracy represent.
- Distributed network of metric collectors. Of security information we should feed into cve bin tool. Maybe start by creating checker entrypoint for a checker which knows it’s running under a dataflow. Could execute using runpy with opimp self in globals. OpImp shared config property of object which is dataflow as class which listens for new vuln info for checker in background when instantiated. When a new vuln is detected we could trigger a scan on all previously scanned atrifacts for which we had scanned before by having a strategic plan overlayed on a long running flow which inspects historical contexts which executed scans against checker came up as exists within file scanned. Use this presence of existence within previous scans to query off chain data from historical system contexts. To build next contexts where results of scan opperatuon are removed so that running results in latest vuln info being incorporated into scan. This is analogous to dev pull model when new commit on branch released. Do scan rerun is same as redoing A/B feature testing of commits.
