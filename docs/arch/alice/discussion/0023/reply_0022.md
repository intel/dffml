- The Open Architecture enables hybrid on/off chain smart contacts.
  - It does this by incorporating risk management into architecture definition / smart contract.
    - Strategic plans work with the gatekeeper and prioritizer to negotiate and execute off chain contracts.
    - Models within strategic plans are involved in risk tolerance.
  - Smart contracts with understanding of risk are effectively entities making decisions based on models. This allows for mutation in implementation while maintaining principles.
    - The smart contract is able to make its own decisions based on learned experience (models) so as to continue to operate until its strategic goals are meet. As measured by oracle data ordained from trusted parties as is applicable to context.
