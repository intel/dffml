- The Open Architecture enables hybrid on/off chain smart contacts.
  - It does this by incorporating risk management into architecture definition / smart contract.
    - Strategic plans work with the gatekeeper and prioritizer to negotiate and execute off chain contracts.
    - Models within strategic plans are involved in risk tolerance.
  - Smart contracts with understanding of risk are effectively entities making decisions based on models. This allows for mutation in implementation while maintaining principles.
