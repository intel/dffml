  - We are submitting Asks to be rewarded for aligned system context remembrance (read), hypothesis(infer), or execution(read/write).
    - They really mean execute some architecture (maybe a dataflow) which would allow for scoped sandboxed execution to given constraints.
      - Constraints are part of the strategic plans which would result in a dropped system context from the gatekeeper. - Reworded to below
      - Constraints exist as a concept which are implemented via strategic plans. Strategic plans which result in a dropped system context by the gatekeeper, are called design constraints.
        - > Design constraints are conditions that need to happen for a project to be successful.
