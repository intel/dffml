- Map English language text instructions from issue / engineering logs to execution of development activies
- How do we preserve privacy? By chains if trust via acceptabilty of provenance determined by startegic plans
- The strategic plans are the soul
  - ask system context contains strategic plans in did doc with soul for the entity for that job. This means all contraint strategic plans are included in the system context referenced in the ask along with any trained models to be used for cached execution when evaluating aligned system contexts with evaluating entities startegic plans overlayed so as to account for their priorities.
  - The PFI, bob in this case, responds with a did which contains a system cobtext which has a verifiable chain of parent Input objects which are DID docs for each system context and operation from which the aligned system context came from (its open liniage / sawtooth / gird / cosign / rekot provenance).
  - Alice loads the aligned system context and executes its deployment which retrieves the provenance information from its cached state within a sandboxed environment (allowlist opimpn similar to subset source).
  - Alice verifies the provenance information by feeding it to her verifier(s) of choice.
  - Alice accepts the offer.
  - Bob executes the contract
  - alice sets triggers to verify bob is executing contract and files reviews upon completion or timeout or other conditions as agreed to within counterofferâ€™s aligned system context.

  - We are submitting Asks to be rewarded for aligned system context remembrance (read), hypothesis(infer), or execution(read/write).
    - They really mean execute some architecture (maybe a dataflow) which would allow for scoped sandboxed execution to given constraints.
      - Constraints are part of the strategic plans which would result in a dropped system context from the gatekeeper. - Reworded to below
      - Constraints exist as a concept which are implemented via strategic plans. Strategic plans which result in a dropped system context by the gatekeeper, are called design constraints.
        - > Design constraints are conditions that need to happen for a project to be successful.

- The ConditionalOffer sourceCurrency is the did of the aligned context
  - coming from bob who is the pfi
  - The ask is from alice with her startegic plan suggested system context. She has 0 and she wants 1.
  - Bob is PFI. He can execute but wants reward in terms of 1 execution of a different system context used as currency given by did
