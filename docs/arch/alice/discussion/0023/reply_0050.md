- Boris Mann
  - CWAY (Sign in with Etherium)
  - Sign in with everything
  - Signing using keys, no blockchain transaction happens
  - Blockchain wallets are the latest PKI, we don't have to solve keymanagement
  - Once you sign, you are restricted to a single tab (due to metamask being a per tab thing)
    - Se
- Sergey Ukstov
  - Would you like to give this website/ application to get these permissions for this set of actions
    - That effectivly creates a very basic capability chain
    - Ephemeral session key created for each sign in
    - Could do this with COCAO, but then you have a whole different world behind that browser tab (k8s, JWT, JWS style stuff)
      - Why not use JWT, JWS
      - For this to work, this delegation, we need to reference the parent capability
        - This need to access the parent capability as signed by the wallet is the topic of discussion
        - Main issue is the JWT algo
          - Need to support secp256k1 and BLS
          - There are JWS signing inputs which are needed
