- I think that the topic to start is about ensuring there is consensus amongst implementers about what fields exist within JWT so that it's UCAN standard
  - Spec says, this is the minimum
    - There are further specs, however the downside is:
      - If someone doesn't like the existing implementation
  - Pure IPDL is deterministic
- Irakli
  - Sign with wallet key
  - CLient side genreate key pair
  - Root issuer of cap is a service, doesn't have to be, sometimes is self issued, they are a claim, the resource is yours
  - Looking at doing keybase style signing
- Boris Mann
  - Says that 50 millions accounts will be able to sign on if this works using this
- Sergey Ukstov
  - CWAY (Sign in with Etherium)
  - Sign in with everything
  - Signing using keys, no blockchain transaction happens
  - Blockchain wallets are the latest PKI, we don't have to solve key management
  - Once you sign, you are restricted to a single tab (due to metamask being a per tab thing)
  - Would you like to give this website/ application to get these permissions for this set of actions
    - That effectively creates a very basic capability chain
    - Ephemeral session key created for each sign in
    - Could do this with COCAO, but then you have a whole different world behind that browser tab (k8s, JWT, JWS style stuff)
      - Why not use JWT, JWS
      - For this to work, this delegation, we need to reference the parent capability
        - This need to access the parent capability as signed by the wallet is the topic of discussion
        - Main issue is the JWT algo
          - Need to support secp256k1 and BLS
          - There are JWS signing inputs which are needed
          - Irakli Gozalighvili: You could derive JWT form out of data to be signed, then just sign with other key?
          - JOT (aka JWT) and UCAN are strikingly similar but incompatible
            - Key ordering, key duplication, whitespace (all permitted by the JWT spec)
              - We're 
- IPLD structure ideally would not generate the JWT to sign
  - We are moving to proofs
  - Boris: "SIWE is attempting to standardize and get this into all wallet clients"
  - If you go from IPLD to JWT you can deterministically generate
    - If you can't deterministically generate with JWT you can do with CBOR
