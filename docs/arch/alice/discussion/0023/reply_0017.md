Certain brain pathways do not fire sometimes or for some agents. When they do they have a value. This is like the gatekeeper and the prioritizer. When used in either prediction mode or live execution mode. Strategic plans inputs are the inputs that should trigger things. Like a slip of the tongue would be caused by an incorrect classification from the gatekeeper. It failed to take some strategic plan into account that would have stopped the slip. We may be able to trace that via lack of provenance or we might be able to theorize based on encoder decoder models from labeled “human” perspective data “energy,vibe,feel,subjective data” mapped to other historical outputs from system context chains/trains. Where the labels are joined with the historical data so as to have manually classified each one. Of course we can
