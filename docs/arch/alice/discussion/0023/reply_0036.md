- Look at other open source communities for practices
  - submit early submit often, as soon as you have data give it to the chain so others can think abou tit
  - chormium intent to impelemnt process (doing relevenet standard if there is one)
    - ADRs (manifests) establish intent of design
      - This is the part where Alice is trying to figure out what operations fit toegether ot form valida data flow and data transformations

  - We don't need to care about using the key for encryption, because we only need it to anchor the root of trust into a web2 world we trust (keybase, github, etc.)

  - > The KERI principle for a did:uni method and its associated DID doc is that the control authority over the did doc must be established as part of any verifier seeking verification. So following KERI principles in DID:peer should fix the problem. I don't know exactly yet what that fix looks like for did:peer. In KERI the did:doc is not the root of trust, the KERL is. The did:doc may provide a snapshot of the KERL or a reference to the KERL by which the did:doc authenticity may be established. Thus moving did:peer to a KERI approach changes how one looks at a did:peer DID Doc. One could use a sequence of did:peer DID DOCs as the equivalent of a KERL but the control establishment for each new DID Doc would have follow KERI principles. Each version of a DID Doc would function either as an establishment event or a non-establishment event in the KERI parlance. Those versions that function as establishment events would have to be signed appropriately in order to establish the transfer of control authority (rotate) keys. So a did:doc could no
  - t be used in an inconsistent sequence of events without being detectable.
