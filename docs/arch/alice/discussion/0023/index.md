# Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

> Blog series

Together we'll build Alice. We'll be successful when Alice successfully maintains a codebase as the only maintainer for a year. Debugging issues, writing fixes, reviewing code, accepting pull requests, refactoring the code base post PR merge, dealing with vulnerabilities, cutting releases, maintaining release branches, and completing development work in alignment with the plugin's universal blueprint. She will modify, submit pull requests to, and track upstreaming of patches to her dependencies to achieve the cleanest architecture possible. We'll interact with her as we would any other remote developer.

We'll need to build the foundations of Alice's thought processes. Throughout this series, we'll rely heavily on a mental model based on how humans think and problem solve. By the end of this series we'll have ensured Alice has all the primitive operations she requires to carry out the scientific process.

### What is Alice?

Alice is an architecture for code that will write and maintain itself based off of a standard description of architecture, a universal blueprint. The universal blueprint is universal because it's intuitive enough that anyone can begin using it quickly after the correct way of communicating to that individual is established via some communication method (spoken language, visual of some kind, text, etc.). This universal blueprint is an abstraction layer between descriptions of architecture within different domain specific representations.

This universal blueprint (system context) is an integral part of creating a shared language for meaning and intent between humans and an Artificial General Intelligence. The goal is to provide an architecture and implementation for independent entities which act in accordance with guiding strategic plans/blueprints. This architecture must be safe and secure by default, scalable, and easily extensible.

- InnerSource is where we learn what Alice should consider to be quality code

- CI/CD is where we learn how Alice can run and deploy code

- Supply Chain Security is how we learn how Alice can create a compute network suitable for various edge deployment scenarios. Edge deployment scenarios being the usage of all assets she has at her disposal. This is where she'll be comprehending security.

The end goal is to create a software architect, Alice. She will consult on existing projects to provide analysis of their architectures and properties such as maintainability, provide guidance for developer workstream prioritization to achieve strategic business goals, and write and maintain codebases herself, accepting contributions from external contributors.

### Terminology

- Universal Blueprint
  - Standard architecture we use to describe anything. Provides the ability to use / reference domain specific architectures as needed to define architecture of whole.
- Think
  - Come up with new data flows and system context input
- Thoughts
  - Data Flows and system context input pairs (these two plus orchestration config we get the whole system context)

### Expectations

Alice is going to be held to very high standards. We should expect this list to grow for a long time (years). This list of expectations may at times contain fragments which need to be worked out more and are only fragment so the ideas don't get forgotten. 

- Alice should be able to work on any project as a remote developer
  - She should be able to make changes to projects following the branch by abstraction methodology
- Alice will maintain a system which allows her to respond to asynchronous messages
  - Likely a datastore with the ability to listen for changes
  - Changes would be additions of messages from different sources (email, chat, etc.)
- Alice should be able to accept a meeting, join it, and talk to you
  - You should be able to have a conversation about a universal blueprint and she should be able to go act on it.
- We should be able to see Alice think and understand her trains of thought

### Alice's Understanding of Software Engineering

We'll teach Alice what she needs to know about software engineering though our InnerSource series. She'll follow the best practices outlined there. She'll understand a codebase's health in part using InnerSource metric collectors.

Alice will see problems and look for solutions. Problems are gaps between the present system capabilities and desired system capabilities or interpretations of outputs of strategic plans which are unfavorable by the strategic decision maker or the prioritizer.

### Naming

You can name it or call it whatever you like. This blog series will call it Alice. Alice will be used to refer to the entity carrying out this job of maintainer. The name Alice will also be used to refer to the AGI in general, the architecture through which one can instantiate arbitrary entities. In effect, the whole bit is arbitrary, and you can call it whatever you like.

Being that Alice is the nickname for both our an entity and the architecture in general. Alice when used in reference to the architecture is a stand in for the the technical term for the architecture. Not sure what the right technical term is right now. Maybe something like: data centric fail safe architecture for artificial general intelligence.

The original usage of DFFML was nicknamed George. George analyzed open source dependencies. This was his "job". 

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is in the public domain, which is a great reason to leverage it for reuse. It's all over the place, just massive chaos, nothing makes sense. Alice navigates the chaos.

Also, in cryptography Alice and Bob are already commonly used names. So there's some shared understanding in the community that Alice is the name of a theoretical entity.

Also when George got a name people started liking him a lot more, talking positively about him, making quips about him. It's just more fun to give the inanimate object a name. Or a personality, oh George doesn't like that repo! I'm sure Alice would agree that things are a lot more interesting when inanimate objects have names and personalities.
