We need to identify good first targets are for what skills we should teach Alice. At first she will start out as more of a helper than an implementer. Think of her like a set of CI jobs you can take from project to project, because they are capable of understanding development practices within an arbitrary codebase. She'll help us identify problems with patchsets in their current form and suggest new approaches when things aren't working. Eventually sheâ€™ll be able to do things on her own.

Ideas for things we should teach her:

- Best practices alignment
  - Identify when random numbers are being pulled from pseudo random sources
- Latest and greatest alignment
  - Identify model architectures in use and recommend more modern ones if old ones noticed
