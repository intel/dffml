- Alice convert to polyrepo path/to/dffml
  - filter branch out subdirectories with packages, create github repos for them.
  - Create mirrors for dependencies, ensure we are always building from our forks of all the dependencies
  - Stream 10 rebuild C/C++ packages on the fly with patches applied via overlays.
- We can do `system_context_as_class` but not `dataflow_as_class` because dataflows have no method of execution without an orchestrator.
  - We should switch the overlay infrastructure to support taking a system context instead of a dataflow.
