  - Ned! NTT to him.
  - This is 3 years ago, think remember reading this
  - Last talked to him about DIDs he said CBOR would be great (DICE)
- NFTs on Peer DIDs allow us to build graph
  - Immediate Goals: leverge existing off-chain storage interfaces provided by nft.stroage and authentication via ucan (based on DIDs) to act as portion of gateway for our reverse engineering environment where we attempt to get data into firefly DLT based on DIDs.

    - Recording where we are talking about this is about 30 minutes into https://youtu.be/u2ZyqX-9xk8
    - Autocodec maps to our shim / manifest encoding as DNA discussion
  - https://github.com/nftstorage/nft.storage/tree/main/examples/ucan-node
- Intercept route
  - identity aware context -> ucan (via cbor) -> dice (device attestation)
    - Allows us to share attestations via opencreds type stuff across humans / machines when our strategic plans are attempting to mitigate risk via execution of operations via implementations which have attestested properties

  - Detection of methods for smart contracts
  - Should we encode to smart contract and be an execution engine for that?
- Execution of contracts were rewarded party executes off chain system context needs information within network up front to make decision about if a party is able to accept a reward.
- One possible flow for rewards
  - Strategic plans publish system contexts they want executed to chain
    - Call for Proposals to execute or hypothesize
    - Mint NFT for system context on DID backed chain
  - Other agents in network publish proposed applicable system contexts including what provenance information would be provided (what SLSA level can an agent meet). References to previous executions with provenance information.
    - Like a reverse bid/purchased.
      - Ideally multiple NFT can be purchased multiple times (maybe we really want at fungible token for this use case if we can issue more than one?).
      - NFTs might be good for results / outputs and FTs might be good for issueing requests for thought (do something with this system context).
      - NFTs are likely also a help to use in solving our distributed locking needs (Inputs with `lock=True` are likely NFTs).
    - If agent buys the system context originally minted within this example, then we have agreed to a contract which says 
- For this recording
  - [ ] Ensure nft.storage can interact with DID based blockchain (firefly, transact?)
  - [ ] Deploy nft.storage and interact with it via UCAN token auth
  - [ ] Dump resulting chain
  - [ ] Reconstruct chain via Python code in `dffml.git/operations/peerdid` (tree has it wrong in previous commits, folder named `peerid` instead of what it should be: `peerdid`)
