  - Ned! NTT to him.
  - This is 3 years ago, think remember reading this
  - Last talked to him about DIDs he said CBOR would be great (DICE)
- NFTs on Peer DIDs allow us to build graph
  - Immediate Goals: leverge existing off-chain storage interfaces provided by nft.stroage and authentication via ucan (based on DIDs) to act as portion of gateway for our reverse engineering environment where we attempt to get data into firefly DLT based on DIDs.

    - Recording where we are talking about this is about 30 minutes into https://youtu.be/u2ZyqX-9xk8
    - Autocodec maps to our shim / manifest encoding as DNA discussion

- Intercept route
  - identity aware context -> ucan (via cbor) -> dice (device attestation)
    - Allows us to share attestations via opencreds type stuff across humans / machines when our strategic plans are attempting to mitigate risk via execution of operations via implementations which have attestested properties
