  - > A qubit uses the quantum mechanical phenomena of superposition to achieve a linear combination of two states. A classical binary bit can only represent a single binary value, such as 0 or 1, meaning that it can only be in one of two possible states. A qubit, however, can represent a 0, a 1, or any proportion of 0 and 1 in superposition of both states, with a certain probability of being a 0 and a certain probability of being a 1.
- applied quantum computing train of thought
  - this qubit is perfect for the circle, the everything is one, the infinity between zero and on - elightnement: everything is one 
    - Therefore really does the quibit just represent the deviation from one? We are always hoping between system contexts. Is this some sort of where did we land? How aligned was the system context with what we we requested?
