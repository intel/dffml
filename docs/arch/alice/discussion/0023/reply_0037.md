- RBAC on DIDs via provenance and dynamic trust relationships
- Failure Mode Analysis
  - For each compoeent of infra srcutrue you use you define failure modes as strategic plans outputs
    - Attah to each failure mode obseravabiltiy metrics via consuming them via strategic plans
      - Based on those observiablity metrics you desgign mittiations via strategic plans
