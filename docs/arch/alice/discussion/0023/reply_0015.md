### Nice to have

- [ ] DID as CBOR

### Security Considerations

- [ ] Peer DID size inspection on pre-receive / receive from Distributed Web Node (DWN)
  - [ ] Default strategic plan overlay enabled to not write to disk or receive to memory DIDs beyond certain size threshold. Can traverse input network to determine system local resource constraints - can go through operations to trigger refresh of local resources, see recording for telemetry example.
