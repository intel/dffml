  - What do we want?
    - CVE Bin Tool scan distoros
      - Standard format for a distro? Container image
      - Leverage `reg` as used here https://gist.github.com/pdxjohnny/a0dc3a58b4651dc3761bee65a198a80d
      - Scan list of images
      - Save cached flows with all inputs linked to did root key via context, context should have did and be linked to the orchetsrator context. The orchestrator context should be linked ot the sytsem context, and the sytem context should be linked to the top level system context. On orchestartor context creation we should apply any overlays.
        - CLI should be entrypont wich calls dataflow which does CLI , coudl apassrochestartor into CLI commands so that they have access somehow if they too run flows (such as the rundataflow CLI commands)
          - CLI dataflow should accept CLI args as value of Input, as well as environment variables as another input value
          - The default CLI dataflow will look in `DFFML_OVERLAY` and `-overlay` and apply any overlays before running the rest of the CLI dataflow (sort of like a first stage to the CLI dataflow is to load overlays over itself and then re-execute).
          - Ensure determine overlay operation gets called before execute_cli_with_overlays.
- NEW `-overlay` now means the dataflow we are giong to execute which will be passed a dataflow. The overlay dataflow will (via operations in it) execute any setup required, apply overlays to input dataflow, and then execute input dataflow.
  - If overlay is not given it defaults to just executing the target dataflow (passthrough overlay)
- `console_entry`
  - `run(cli_dataflow, memoryorchestrator)`
    - `return_passthrough_overlay_or_overlay_loaded_as_dataflow_from_cli_args_or_env(args, env)`
    - execute overlay dataflow
      - execute dataflow
- We should modify operations and the orchestrators to not pass any orchestrator context or orchestrator context sub variables that are not predeclared. 
  - Declare what of anything an Operation wants to use from the orchestrator context up front in the allowlist and declare what the acceptable interface definition is (class, manifest)
