- an algorithm for a generic entity
- You can look at any problem (i.e. system context) through N different lenses. Through the eyes of N different entities. What each person “sees” or rather, experiences, is a combination of raw data (feature extraction) and feel. Mind. interpretation. Perspective. The results from different output flows overlayed on a cached or in progress execution, hypthesis, etc.

  - > Something that old boring process literature talk about (Toyota, The Goal etc) that applies to software engineering 10000000% is that minimizing the size of the feedback loop is much more important for productivity than minimizing idleness
  - Why? The more useful data we have, the more precise we can be with the control portion of our feedback loop. Splitting into small feedback loops (like refactoring into a set of functions with locality or trustbonudries understood) helps us measure more granularly.
- TODO
  - `alice new architecture <project-name>`
    - Have alice guess based on parent system context and project name what kind of project she should create (operations -> within `operations/` or name `-operations-<something>`
    - Run setup tasks overlayed from parent system context
      - You use github? Create a github repo for it
      - You want to register a project name with your container registery you usally use, right?
