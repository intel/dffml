- to generate new system contexts
  - if the data type looks like a match on an operation input use the trained adaptive sandboxing models to predict if the input falls in a non error cluster. Error is defined by exceptions raised during operation execution. There is more to this thought somewhere …
- an algorithm for a generic entity, modeling the mind
- Tune scaling methods via locality and trust boundary topologies 
- Always think in parallel. Use response time to know length if time we can explore train of thought before we need to send control signals associated with that train of thought.
- You can look at any problem (i.e. system context) through N different lenses. Through the eyes of N different entities. What each person “sees” or rather, experiences, is a combination of raw data (feature extraction) and feel. Mind. interpretation. Perspective. The results from different output flows overlayed on a cached or in progress execution, hypthesis, etc.

  - > Something that old boring process literature talk about (Toyota, The Goal etc) that applies to software engineering 10000000% is that minimizing the size of the feedback loop is much more important for productivity than minimizing idleness
  - Why? The more useful data we have, the more precise we can be with the control portion of our feedback loop. Splitting into small feedback loops (like refactoring into a set of functions with locality or trustbonudries understood) helps us measure more granularly.
- TODO
  - `alice new architecture <project-name>`
    - Have alice guess based on parent system context and project name what kind of project she should create (operations -> within `operations/` or name `-operations-<something>`
    - Run setup tasks overlayed from parent system context
      - You use github? Create a github repo for it
      - You want to register a project name with your container registery you usally use, right?
