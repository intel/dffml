- DevCloud for compute?
- Treat modeling tool yaml as output for helping our initial volume 1 chapter 1 thoughts on threat model generation
- Remap output op in default overlay with dataflow which does a remap operation within it which grabs all the dataflows with get multi, expands them, merges them, then the parent remap operation takes the output of the next level down remap and outputs a get single on the merged dataflow dict, converts it back into a dataflow, and returns it
- Common use cases for overlays
  - Org specific RBAC on operations
  - Adding new Operation Implementation networks accessible to loaded dataflows
    - Overriding operations within loaded flows use org specific implementations
      - In it's simplest cases this means identifying matching interfaces via operation config and input data types and valid transformations into those types respecting linage and other previously mentioned methods of determination (adaptive sandboxes as one example, strategic plan model predictions as another)
  - TODO
    - In non default overlays, apply overlay to each operation, after or before prioritization, or both, could be even different overlays.
    - Use overlays to apply prioritizers to operations.
