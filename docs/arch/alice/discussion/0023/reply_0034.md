Bridging the web2/web3 Identity Gap

he DID doc offers no endpoint. This makes the DID functionally equivalent to a did:key value, and visually similar, except that a peer DID will have the numeric algorithm as a prefix, before the multibase encoded, multicodec-encoded public key. For example, did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH is equivalent to did:peer:0z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH. The did:peer version differs in that it is upgradeable to a dynamically updatable DID with full DID doc and endpoints, simply using deltas, as long as the first delta is authenticated by the inception key.
