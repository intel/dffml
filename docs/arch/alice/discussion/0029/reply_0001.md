- Find all potential paths for change in state of consciousness by analyzing across system context executing in different states (rolling stages? This is kind of how it already works, just a mode which says when your done start back at the beginning. Think this is already covered by the prioritization provenance and system cobtext povenanance). We can then begin to attempt to trigger those paths to move any system from ine concious state to the next. This also allows for discovery of new states of consciousness via classification of predicted valid system contexts. We do this via the cross domain conceptual mapping we use to see things from another perspective, aka the different set of output operations.
