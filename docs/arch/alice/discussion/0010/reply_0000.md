DANGER! TODO(security) Burnout and spinout. Sudden halt to growth of strategic plan / principle spider chart outwards and sudden reversal of strategic plan outputs.

Remember she will be oversubscribed! Watch the valleys, they’re dangerous, that dip below the wave in your moving average where it crosses the 20 and the 100 day type of thing. Remember we want to see growth in plan outputs / principles. prioritize strategies based on trend forecasts.

TODO Alice, explore the field of psychological operations research and formulate threats and mitigations to your architecture using what you learned. Use cross domain conceptual mapping to a search for likely equilibriums (end states) we can produce using conceptually similar methodologies.

Using cross domain conceptual mapping. We can explain to Alice that we keep a dog on a leash to keep it safe, for its own security. At the expense of its freedom (and a plethora of other analogies) we can ensure she has a solid training dataset for what not to do, as well as what to do, to preserve our freedom, privacy, and security, within different yet unseen contexts. The effect of this when we scale up and begin yo think strategically is that she will understand freedom, privacy, and security and how to mitigate threats to those areas strategically as good or better than we can (since she’ll be able to see more thing at the same time as is to think more strategically, that oversubscribed system causing good chaos, learning in one domain accelerating learning in another.
