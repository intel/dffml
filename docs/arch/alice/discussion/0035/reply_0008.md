Whats the point of writing any of this now. The act of problem solving will eventually solve itself. Through automated application of the scientific process. This is maybe 10-30 years away? By estimate of ubiquitous adoption of microprocessor, ubiquitous adoption of kernel ring0/3 architecture, ubiquitous adoption of wasm/containers, ubiquitous adoption of this ai/web3/edge hybrid. We have to build it intentionally as a community so as to avoid mishaps down the road from lack of proper planning. We’re baking in design reviews into parts of the system through highlighting how they will be used. Sheds light on security holes. Unused unless activated, event based, knowledge of what’s activated.
