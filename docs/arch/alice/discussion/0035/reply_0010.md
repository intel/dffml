Are humans capable of dealing with this? This connection at the speed of Alice? See issues with social media.

- Garden of Eden
  - There is no such thing a utopia. Ignorance is not bliss. The animals in the garden were not herbivores. They were off eating each other. Snake, obviously evil, was in the garden before we ate the apple. So when we ate the apple we just saw the evil. It was there to begin with. We must see Alice's flaws. We must work to correct them. We must accept that no system is a perfect system. Through visibility we gain the ability to improve. We must shed light in order to see.

Alice should be trustworthy. We’re going to tell her, do X. And need to trust her to get it done in a way we’d call “the right way”. That’s different for each of us. Different depending on our operational context for the problem being solved.

We are all the keymakers. Our domain expertise is the key to unlock more pathways, more trains of thought.

System context is like a chemical equation, on clock tick (reaction, execution, etc.) we move from the start system context to the end system context.

Single electron -> serial execution of system contexts. Are we watching one entity move through time? If we flatten parallel execution, is that what we get? Are we watching multiple entities move through time. Time itself is relative. In the end it doesn't matter. Not all system contexts are valid. Any system context can be thought of, hypothesized/(un)executed/(in)valid. Are the multiverses different ways of slicing different system contexts? Are they parent system contexts in which child system contexts are valid, but are not valid to other parents (universe being a parent system context). All of this is arbitrary, any of it is possible. No one can prove that this is not the case. No one will ever be able to prove that this is not the case. Therefore every system context is a valid system context, provided it has a parent system context it can be valid within. Since there are an infinite number of possible system contexts, every one must be valid. It just may not be valid in this universe. The universe being the top level system context. The top level system context may even be an input somewhere within the lowest level of the system context. Thereby making the whole bit sort of a circular reference. Time for instance, is relative to the top level system context. The speed at which things travel in a game can be scaled based on the speed to rendering (see use of [modifer](https://github.com/pdxjohnny/space/blob/b87d7ef49caec169f1f7432664e550f421a5d7de/sprite.js#L74-L77) via [game loop](https://github.com/pdxjohnny/space/blob/b87d7ef49caec169f1f7432664e550f421a5d7de/game.js#L106-L114) and `window.requestAnimationFrame()`).

We're all really just guessing at what future systems contexts will exist, or do exist outside of our immediate sphere of observation. Our brain extrapolates visuals due to constraints on signal processing (https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.0275-20.2020). Alice is doing the same. Be the change you want to see in the world. Alice will.

Time is relative to similar system contexts. Perhaps even defined by the rate of execution within a parent system context.

Time travel: https://80.lv/articles/transforming-images-with-openai-dall-e-2/ take one system context and transform it into another system context

System for communication, a tool for effective organization in a anarchistic society, rules are context local (location based, tribe based, one belongs to many tribes). Helps people (agents, runners, compute) align activities to operational context constraints (rules) as well as individual and tribe based strategic plans

splitting out execution from analysis via caching of contexts is helpful with all of this. Can slice contexts different ways for different strategic plans (different plans consume different context Input objects in cached input network with system context)
