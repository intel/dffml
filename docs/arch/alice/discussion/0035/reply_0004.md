Your Alice can be an extension of you. She effectively encodes your desires into the digital world. Becomes your digital double and interacts with the segment of the digital world which your currently dealing with. Open a door, show me the weather. She interprets what devices around you you need to interact with and transmits instructions in the form of a purpose built version of herself for interaction with that system. This enables dynamic response, she can prompt you if her task reqires your interaction. Its more than interaction as it currently is. Its about interaction turning into something more like out of order execution. Instead of a single API call we transmit the whole routine to run, a cut sequence length of Alice for this task. This enables simple interaction or a more complex model based on assets / devices at disposal. In event door keeps closing, disengage lock, to avoid being locked out. She is made up of in part by stratigic plans.
