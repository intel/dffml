- Team Topologies
- InnerSource, CI/CD, Analytics to accelerate delivery and innovation
  - Helps us understand the skill levels of our contributors and how to most effectively utilize them.
    - Form teams based on qualities of programmers to ensure we have teams to match workstreams for all four flows. Always able to build the optimal teams to execute any business strategy.
      - You'll find and identify gaps
  - InnerSource is our measurement and suggestion mechanism to enable independent agents to collaborate most effectively towards shared goals (strategic plans generating system contexts and going through prioritizer)


- Why do InnerSource?

- Open Source is how companies optimize engineering resources across companies.
- Employees move from project to project and grow skills
  - Those skills are tracked as they change role (people apply for roles they have had experience with before for adjacent technologies and topologies and modes.
- Agents outgrow the problem space they are working on at some rate (important metric! rate of agent learning within train of thought, agents might be made up of opimps with models that get better the larger the time delta between instantiation and usage is. This is an agent learning how to be good at something)
  - The trains of thought we know how to evaluate one execution on might be different for a different environment.
    - We can run different clustering models over different data to understand relationship between training and test data (for example similar work needed to close an issue)
  - We're really building a system that helps us understand ourselves and helps us organize effetely in a distributed setting taking into account the plans of the organization and the plans of the agents, in terms of outputting thoughts which optimize for targets measured within organizational scoped strategic plans (optimize for time to delivery, optimize for cost, optimize for agent performance: speed + quality over time) when taking into account what plans are generated and prioritized. An agent might have a long term strategy to become an expert in some area. We can use that information as prioritizer inputs. This allows agents a feedback mechanism to the strategic decision maker to tell it what learning objectives they have. People learn best when their work aligns with their passion. We want to take that into account when passions are changing and optimize in part for that in a strategic plan (output information about suggested plan which is feed into prioritizer to this effect). This allows us to combine work orders coming from the business with 
  - It's a system for effective anarchistic organization where agents can communicate and effectively organize to achieve agreed upon policies as applicable in any given situation (emphisis here is on that situation being dynamic, agents make descisions based on available information as they are aware about alignment to stragetic plans in effect for them as decided by the pools of agents which they join (OperationImplementationNetwork).
    - Agents that change pools are analyzed to understand metrics leading to change. This allows us to optimize for change policies.

- Map to measured properties of a project from all collectors. Train clustering model over it and you'll be able to understand what projects are similar. You can then map that to architectures and figure out what kinds of teams of agents you'll need for new project (a new project is what do we think will happen if we introduce a new set of strategic plans, we can guess by adding desired train or test data to a cached system context in place of the new plans yet to be collected data, we can use a model we trained against a training dataset of such contexts by looking at the inputs from the network that the new strategic plan is consuming from the training data and use it to predict output values. This will help us in the event that we don't have access to inputs we need to run a plan, we can decide to use the predicted value for that plan until we get a new data point) as they go through planning. You can also use this to understand yellow card pull cost to work on patching vulns (metric of: vulns * time * cost to mitigate / lifetime of project) and get a complete picture of 

- The goal of this whole thing is optimal resource utilization of agents (engineers).
  - We have agents capable of exploration with particular qualities that make them work well in certain team topologies when operating in certain modes to get better outputs from some strategic plan whose metric we wish to move in a particular direction.
  - As a case study we will create a hypothetical team of consultants.
  - We will use the data collection abilities of DFFML to collect as much data as we can about engagements.
    - We collect data on their work and their objectives (commits, issues, branches, etc.)
  - We will train models to understand the optimal team topologies for our set of consultants
    - As new strategic plans are introduced the strategic plans, decision maker, and prioritizer suggest possible future courses of action
      - Record of if courses of action were taken or not lies in the capturing all changes to system context.

- Start with the vision
  - As few words are possible: optimize for domain expertise. Increasing productivity by removing barriers to knowledges. That’s what we need in and InnerSource gives us that.
- T-shirt sized montra - slide 1
- If you can visualize it that will help a lot to
- Here are the three points to the vision
  - Architecture
  - Domain Expertise

- Take them through the story
- Vision: Help developers go faster with better quality
- Way down at the bottom we have something involving SGX
- Make sure to have c4models
- Think about argument as constructing a building
- Think about how the building interacts with the human element. How to do doors, windows, light coming in, how does that interact with users.
- How to architect it for engineers to use, it’s intuitive
- Always think about how it’s being used
- Think about how things fit together
  - Architects mindset is all about structure
    - You can go to far
- As soon as agent understands what needs to get done agent executes the best it can
