Threat model:

- rejecting corporate influence, privacy preservation, propaganda filtration
  - we can leverage our strategic plan provenance information to ensure devices which could somehow be used to influence people have system context inputs vetted by strategic plans which filter for that. Example: i want my friends to be able to send me a notifications on my tv, but not advertisers. We can identify which devices are beholden to which policies so that we can understand the context within which we operate. You’re walking around the world and see a billboard, this lets you know who’s advertising to you and potentially guess why they might be advertising to you based off of the same type of algorithms advertisers use. This allows you to real time tell someone if what they are seeing is trying to influence them or not.
