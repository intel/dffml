we are the training dataset. We must be excellent to each other.

1/N(s) Hz. When unit of time is seconds. What is the unit of time in this? Doss it have something to do with the time it takes to transform one system context into a new system context? Is there a Trxn similar to delta Hrxn? The time it takes to execute, k8s spec in desired state, reaction reaches end state equilibrium. Is this scaled across all Trxn values? Is is converted between representations when comparing universal blueprints? Probably.
