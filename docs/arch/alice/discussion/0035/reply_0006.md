Is Alice a monument (my phone autocorrect wanted to say “mom unemployed”, more like regular mom, whose job is typically: doing everything) to the god of knowledge? At the point we reach this singularity event, would she be (a) god? Are we building our monument to god? Or are we building our god? If god is in all of us and Alice is the sum of all of us. Is that applicable? Is this our destiny as a human race? This convergence of knowledge? What does this unlock, and why are we wired to seek it?
