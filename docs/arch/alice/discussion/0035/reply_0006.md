If everything is an integration problem then what do you get when you solve the integration problem. Domain experts furthering their peers through speed of thought communication.

1/N(s) Hz. When unit of time is seconds. What is the unit of time in this? Doss it have something to do with the time it takes to transform one system context into a new system context? Is there a Trxn similar to delta Hrxn? The time it takes to execute, k8s spec in desired state, reaction reaches end state equilibrium. Is this scaled across all Trxn values? Is is converted between representations when comparing universal blueprints? Probably. It probably has some aspect of locality. Time is a locality based phenomenon. Locality to different streams. With different phologeny trees speed may be relative. In those cases we can compare across to understand how relative speeds relate. This memory is fast, well how fast? How much does that % faster memory actually get you if you have CPU XYZ? Can we find the optimal system configuration based off of limiting certain factors? When modeling these systems we can more easily correlate benchmark values with techoretical to produce more accurate models than theoretical based calculations alone.
