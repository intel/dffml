Can we find out how many degrees removed something is (6 degrees of separation) from something else by treating each as an entity and then see which ones have high accuracy for effect. Used to model how individuals can enact change through collective organization in various groups to increase positive nature of aggregate shared values. Can we do that with train of thought speed? Can we take as an input speed of thought, that 1/N, that unit with some other unit system, Alice's unit system. convertion factor is 1 second = 1/N system contexts within entity within a second. Generations per second. Since each Alice created after top level kick off is a dendent of that line. Save all data, ru with unique contex IDs.
