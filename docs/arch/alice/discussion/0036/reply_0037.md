Contexttual dejavu what does thos system context remind you of. View with other stratigic plans overlayed. Or say these outputs look similar to other outputs from stratigc plans run iver other sytem contexts. Do this by seeing what clusters the outputs fall in. Then train models on the cluster classification to an encoder decider of things you know about those contexts. To tell you what it is that you understand aout them. Whats the himan data that maps to those clusters. Classify contexts manually then train models mapping manually claissified data to unsupervised clusters to see which models achive high accuracy. Do automl with feature engineering. High accuracy modes should allow for prediction lf the manual classification given the unsupervised clustering outputs
