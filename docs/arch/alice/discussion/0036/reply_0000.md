Back to that thing about trust boundaries (buried in an ADR or issue somewhere). Safe mode / extra startigey like experiment cost restrictions might incdulence reuse of operation implementations. Should create method for OpImpNetworks to attempt to transfer to one another. And a method to do the transfer. This would allow live migration, transfer as live object, or from copy.
