Alice is the anser to if you had an SBOM (web3, part of the input, assets, also operations at our disposal come from knowing what opimpnetworks provided them) and you wanted to know all the ways you could use it in different situations (dataflow within base system context or with overlays for each situation or organization for strategic olan analysis) and interpret the effects if running it (strategic plans, ML) or thinking about it or using the data it produced.

data, compute, ML = entity and commodity. As well as architecture for that commodity to produce value within the context of the entities it interacts with. A level playing field, ability to cut out the middle men in any situation and decide how to subcontract out pieces to achive adhoc formed organizational stratigic goals. Like two people who speak different languages communicating to move a couch through a door, a purpose built language is created that gets the job done to communicate to complete the task.
