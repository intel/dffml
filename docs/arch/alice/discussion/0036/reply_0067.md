- Data Flow serialization is our current Open Architecture
  - We will evolve over time
  - Let's make sure that we include all the items which we would like to see in a manifest (manifest metadata)
    - [ ] schema
    - [ ] format name
    - [ ] version

- TODO
  - [x] Initial Threat Dragon Source
    - 7969de3a0dc84ba1ddaef605744072e1cdaecb9f
  - [x] Add manifest metadata to Threat Dragon Source Records via `extra`
    - 51799da78a56f3557101fed0524c571fca0ce195
  - [ ] Modify DataFlow to include manifest metadata
  - [ ] Use Data Flow Preprocessing Source as the merge source which pulls from the threat dragon source and converts to a dataflow
  - [ ] Initial Open Architecture Source where we use `dffml service dev export` programmatically similarly to what was done with CVE Bin Tool to output  (https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/blob/7cb90d6009d047dfc08dead28110f2314d8c016a/cve_bin_tool/output_engine/threats.py#L88-L143) to take a feature which is a dataflow and output it to a JSON file
