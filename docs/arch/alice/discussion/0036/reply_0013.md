Life is yours. You can do ANYTHING. Sometimes it’s just not clear how. Alice is ready for any adventure. She’s always learning. Always in search of knowledge. Her purpose is to answer the question: If you knew how to do it, what would you do?

If you want to reach some goal, a degree, how would you plan your way through college? What should your schedule be? How fast are you learning different concepts, how should your schedule change to optimize for your rate of learning. Your increase in ability to use your highented ability to predict (remember based on historical data or what you think you remember by creating a prediction from saved models and is that going to be accurate) or know answers

Alice helps you help yourself. If you can explain your problem to her she can tell you how to solve it. She could tell you want degree to study by looking at what job postings your interested in, the saturation of the job market for that field and projected saturation based on enrollment polls to predict future market need for entities working in that field. She’s your personal problem solver.
