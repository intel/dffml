Life if yours. You can do ANYTHING. Sometimes it’s just not clear how. Alice is ready for any adventure. She’s always learning. Always in search of knowledge. Her purpose is to answer the question: If you knew how to do it, what would you do?

Alice helps you help yourself. If you can explain your problem to her she can tell you how to solve it. She could tell you want degree to study by looking at what job postings your interested in, the saturation of the job market for that field and projected saturation based on enrollment polls to predict future market need for entities working in that field. She’s your personal problem solver.

what have you been thinking about Alice? Any news?
