Create system contexts with functionality similar differing services written in different languages or whatever. Essentially a invent a codebase for these people to work on to train them. Create a demo environment for me, take a demo environment and make it look like this environment. Take this picture and make it stylisticlly like this other picture. One strategic plan outputs repo objects with langauge object attached. Choose opimps for synthesis that when stubs run through by stratigc plans yield acceptable accuracy result for statisfaction of predicted values of proposed to be synthesised system context stratigic plans being in line with desired stratigic plan otuput results (via multi-output encoder model). This is the same stuff we've already done. Just another translation model.
