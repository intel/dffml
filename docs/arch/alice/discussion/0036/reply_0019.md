Identify entry level agents and ensure they get experience with senior people first. Working on projects that follow best practices. Teams of 2-N. Team size scales for availability of agents, size of work, balancing other priorities. Team topology chosen by adding assets available, agents, and their skills and predicted outcomes to chosen team topologies. We choose optimal team topology by picking it out of its strategic plans

Can use the technique in the below comment to slice and dice to view within context of team topology we see within naturally formed group of agents. Can also use to slice and dice to see their current collaboration models. Can then build multioutput model to map team topologies and collaboration model strategic plan outputs along with other strategic plans outputs to use as inputs into an organizational strategic plan, this will output a result which is consumed by that top level priroritizier of the top level system context within which we are executing.
