- clade
- dichotomous key
  - sometimes things look alike but they are not
  - your way of looking at things. What your strategic plan and models say
  - Can compare a dichotomous key phylogeny to a DNA encoded system context
  - Can compare dna based phylogeny to each other using different genes
    - gene: In biology, a gene is a basic unit of heredity and a sequence of nucleotides in DNA that encodes the synthesis of a gene product, either RNA or protein (is it an operation? which operation implementation is selected?). During gene expression (what environment are we running in), the DNA is first copied into RNA (dataflow instantiated). The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function (can use dataflows to create more dataflows, more system contexts).
