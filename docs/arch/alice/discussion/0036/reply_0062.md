- by putting everything in the web3 space we can hotswap anything within our supply chain simply by supporting serializtion (a gateway) to and from that ibterface (plus transport to relavent chain(s)). Consider web3/odap/peer dids and did methods as the serializatipn format whoch the open architecture is based on. The common application transport portocol. We are defining a layer 8. A thought transport protocol. Where thoughts are executed, recalled from memory, hypothsised, etc. Where a thought is a system context is a dataflow. By doing this atop ODAP (we are also looking at KERI, its not really important what one uses underneath we should call put certain properties of technologies which make them suitable for implementation of this methodology, and give example protocols which one could huild this on, its like how you *can* use wheels and pip to distribute anything but do you want to? Me yes, you maybe want to do it with dpkg, great, sure even the open archecture itself will have an open architecture format architecture. Its all about what can ypu hotswap anyway) achieve interoperability with the web3 ecosystem
