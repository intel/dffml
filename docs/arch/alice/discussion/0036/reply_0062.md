- by putting everything in the web3 space we can hotswap anything within our supply chain simply by supporting serializtion (a gateway) to and from that ibterface (plus transport to relavent chain(s)). Consider web3/odap/peer dids and did methods as the serializatipn format whoch the open architecture is based on. The common application transport portocol. We are defining a layer 8. A thought transport protocol. Where thoughts are executed, recalled from memory, hypothsised, etc. Where a thought is a system context is a dataflow. By doing this atop ODAP (we are also looking at KERI, its not really important what one uses underneath we should call put certain properties of technologies which make them suitable for implementation of this methodology, and give example protocols which one could huild this on, its like how you *can* use wheels and pip to distribute anything but do you want to? Me yes, you maybe want to do it with dpkg, great, sure even the open archecture itself will have an open architecture format architecture. Its all about what can ypu hotswap anyway) achieve interoperability with the web3 ecosystem
- we’re going to put out software supply chain into this distributed model because IT IS DISTRIBUTED. Just in the same that our source code is distributed. Because we need context. Language is contextual, inflection makes one phrase the opposite meaning of the same phrase said with different inflection. This notion of context inherently lends itself towards distributed solutions because context has locality. If we want a truly functional language we must incorporate all context into the language (the open architecture, our shared language with the machine, and can be used to translate therefore into different languages and cultures due to contextual understanding). So what are we doing. Well in a way we’re making everything functional, but in reality we can’t make everything functional so we build models to predict the unknown states between the known states. This allows us to optimize “motor control” skills, muscle memory. The kick is that your brain is a muscle. Its the orchestrator, but on a way its not the only orchestrator. Let us think about the subconscious. An example closer to the concious to start, Dejavu for instance,
