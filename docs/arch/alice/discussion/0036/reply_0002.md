Initial thoughts formed by strategic plans kickstarted at beginning of context kick off. They begin spinning off thoughts (system contexts) which could be moved from start k8s start to template spec state. These are passed to the gatekeeper and then to the prioritizer. Other strategic plans can accept outputs of strategic plans and then generate better guesses at system context. We are guessing at the chemical equation required to satisfy the seed input (the voice command). The prioritizer is trying all ideas it can in order to satisfy the request. Some it really executes, some it just thinks about and does accuracy calculations across nested startigc plan predictions given best guess seed inputs using available resources through operations to achive outputs that satisfy agent, organizational, and requestor statigic plans (withing yhe top level systems context)
