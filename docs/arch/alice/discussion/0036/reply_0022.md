Alice as helpdesk. Did you try viewing the problem this way? Doing this? Hyphoetheis, and hyphothies chosen for execution, ideally with information attached as to why it was chosen for exuction or not.

For prirority consider model maping overall priority being determined as best value when measured as we want to increase the strategic principles, the vision, the core values. Some top level goals, growing more and more abstract, good descsision / bad decsision, always trying to make the best one. But you can't always make the best one, and so you make as many as you can that align with your stragetic principles as possible, when you can, until you reach your stragetgic goals, then you reasses where your vision is at. This cycle is short or long depending on each enagement, each set of strategic plans, these are the different meetings, the different things she has to join, to distribute her parallel compute to work on (viewing the system as a whole).

The pull model dev stuff is like when you and your buddy are working on a PR together, and one of you thinks they knows a suggestion that thye should just go ahead and apply and hit write commit to my buddys branch, write? Well, you're not going to hit CI for that click of a button, but you should. It's just too time consuming. What you really want to know is, what is the impact of me pushing this change. What is the risk. You want to apply to each system context, some stop gap measures. Somethings that says hey buddy,

![OR ENTER. I'M A SIGN. NOT A COP](https://external-preview.redd.it/tPGj-5ixJ-87dW31ator6cW4lVJjdDp-e2TJMNR2MO4.jpg?auto=webp&s=5dab5d390471def9bbd6ed2c76067c1a457854cb "KEEP OUT")

Looks like you're about to blow up prod buddy! Don't think you want to do that! Looks like you're going to leave an unmitigated threat open over there! And then prompt for response, until off, or reach state of satisfaction then back to waiting for activation mode, conscious but not active, thinking, perhaps engaged elsewhere, like note taking in a meeting, that's doing two things at the same time. She is responding to a question she heard and then she's taking notes at the same time via the audio recording. She's the ghost in the shell (`bash` autocomplete from earlier)! Because her mind is this concurrent/parallel execution model. Where she pauses in here running of a context when she requires interaction, waits before scheduling any more none-safe mode threads, or perhaps even a more restricted set of threads when in a locked down mode. Sort of like when you synthesize for a particular hardware architecture (remember Open Architecture union of SW and HW and beyond).

We're going to run all this on top of a web3, wasm, k8s, virtual machine, physical machine (IoT) cluster of devices, each with their own manifests describing each assest they represent and each operation they can preform at granular levels of context. siced and diced in different ways to tell us if we are fulfilling our requiremnts in diffrent areas, these manifets could be provided at time of synthiesis or theyc could be acceswed dyanmically and they are all orchestrated via kcp communicating via DIDs as CRDs with k8s job interface extented to be method calls of dataflow as class contructs (there it is again! it's all the same thing! I love it! Think of it like what kvm does for nested virtualization, see blog post on personal). we should (re)write implementations of all of this in rust (yes, yes, I don't know rust, but obviously those crustations are on to something. but cross platform cross platform cross platform, please help us write it! ADRs for all this (manifests, issues?) are soon to be drafted. I hear they have solid async now. Essentially on start spin up services, operations which take no inputs, for the CLI, this is where we grab into the top level context and read the CLI args and start creating operations, for meeting jioning, this is calling in and starting listening, for running downstream validation, this is altering others of a new system context, one in state executing, or theorizing, to altert others on web3 network that a new thought is active. THey can map to trains of thought as is relative to them. DIDs when created will reference data stored in database of input network, for config obhects, of all data used.
