We're [DFFML community] building a tutorial series where we as a community collaboratively build an AI software architect. These docs **TODO DOCS LINK ONCE WE HAVE ADRS** are us trying to get some initial thoughts down so we can rework from there, maybe even re-write everything. We want to make sure we all start looking at the same picture of the future, consolidate all our efforts thus far and thoughts across efforts and individuals.

My responsibilities have changed, and with that over the next month I hope to be spending a lot more time in the DFFML codebase with you all. We have two new mentors who will be joining us as well Michael and John.
Next week I will get to PR review. This week I will be planning.

I will publicize plan documents here for all to see, provide feedback on and review. If I review your PR please find time to review mine when that come :) I would love it if we could build these documents collaboratively as a team. One way we can do that is for me to write the draft, and then open it up for comments, edits, even re-writing the whole thing. This is a common process in software development. An alternate model is that we'd all get together to create a plan right off the bat. This is more similar to waterfall, it requires we all have many planning meetings to all agree on the text. Certain situations lend themselves to group plan writing, certain situations it's more expedient for everyone due to spread of priorities for a subset of the group to write the initial draft, and the rest of the people then comment, edit, etc. which then makes them co-authors. If you contributed to a commit in a concrete way then that is a reason to list your name in a Co-authored-by git trailer at the end of a commit (see https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/CommitMessageConventions)

I will be streaming all development activity on this project and I believe we should encourage others to do the same. Here are the links if ayone wants to follow along. Please provide questions/comments/concerns/feedback/anything in the linked discussion thread. Video series: Engineering Log: Architecting Alice. Discussion thread: Alice
@TirelessClock +1, scheduling is hard. One of the goals is for us to be able to enter fully connected development model. To plug into the matrix. By working side by side with us Alice will hopefully be able to detect when we've done things others on the team have done in their livestreams. This way we can all work independently while communicating asynchronously via Alice (our hopefully soon to be new contributor). We will work to make her detect in flight workstreams within a developer's train of thought (or train of operations, set of dataflows where one or more dataflows was created based on the system context. The context within which we are developing.
