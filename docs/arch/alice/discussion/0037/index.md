We're [DFFML community] building a tutorial series where we as a community collaboratively build an AI software architect (named Alice). These docs **TODO DOCS LINK ONCE WE HAVE ADRS** are us trying to get some initial thoughts down so we can rework from there, maybe even re-write everything. We want to make sure we all start looking at the same picture of the future, consolidate all our efforts thus far and thoughts across efforts and individuals.

We have new GsoC mentors joining us and will soon have new students as well! We will publicize plan documents here for all to see, provide feedback on and review. We want to build these documents collaboratively as a team. Those who provide concrete feedback will be listed as reviewers via `Reviewed-by-tags`. Those who submit pull requests to edit the documents will be listed via `Co-authored-by` tags. We will map GSoC projects into this long term effort.

One of goals is to have Alice help us bring us up to the speed of the fully connected development model. To plug into the matrix. By working side by side with us, Alice will hopefully be able to detect when we've done things others on the team have done already and determined to be unsuccessful strategies. If Alice can do this we can all work independently while communicating asynchronously via Alice (our hopefully soon to be new contributor). We will work to make her detect in flight workstreams within a developer's train of thought through reporting of that developer on what they are working on. Alice I'm working on getting an HTTP request from Bob's service. Developer you may not want to do that, Bob's service is down, he told me he is working on fixing it, I can tell you when it's back online if you want.
