Strategic plan alignment. There us no path. Many people walk same way. Now there is a path

GAN and autoencoders used to encode non image data such as strategic plans / principles (this is already in this doc somewhere).

Autoencoders unsupervised to supervised clustering

Do demo where we train model permutations on outputs of operations

you can set organiztional policy and agents set their policy. This is like a self reporting servce. Dev/agent chooses how much they want to communicate. Org overlays help agent understand the provenance information required from them to submit work/inputs. This is tied to tbDEX contract stuff
