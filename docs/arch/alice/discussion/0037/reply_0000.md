Strategic plans can take outputs of other strategic plans. These map to layers in a nueral network. The final layer is the srategic principles. Each layer represents a conceptual level of understanding.

Going for a walk. Well Alice knows walking is putting one foot in front of the other one. She knows that there are some rules to that, you cant move the same foot twice. She knows that when sheâ€™s doing it her state of movement is active and the method as analyzed by a strategic plan for if walking says okay i looked at this system context you sent me and it said left foot was active this time. What was the system context that this current one is derived from, was last foot active at that time? In a different context you could have that data coming from a different source but analyze and produce active by a lower strategic model (conceptually) which decides if a leg is active or not. We can come up with X different ways to turn one value in to another value, where X is the number of valid system contexts that can be made within the system constraints (locked values for a system context, immutables, probably should require grabular ability to force override when overlaying) to produce the same output of is walking. Because we need ti think as if we are a parallel mesh of devices. Collaborating and communicating to achive some goals, to make some strategic principles more positive.
