# Rolling Alice: Volume 0: Chapter 11: Entering Wonderland

## The Meaning of Meaningless Riddles

The Merits of Insanity: With enough Chaos comes a closer to objective view of reality. The meaning of meaningless riddles once reaching full insanity becomes only that they are meaningless. They cease to be riddles.

We drop them via policy on federation and re-evaluate past thoughts. Tthe prioritizer as supply chain analysis of thoughts shows the data seeding those riddles does not in fact come from trusted TCBs.

```python
Good_Insane = prioritizer.value_chain_analysis(Good_Insane + Good_Insane)
```

These TCBs might have gone the bad way of insane.

```python
Bad_Insane = prioritizer.value_chain_analysis(Good_Insane + Bad_Insane)
```

## What We Do When 1+1 No Longer Equals 2

Upon detection of a faulty root of trust we must trigger re-evaluation of tainted trains of thought
Roots of trust may begin producing data ungrounded from any shared reality in error through no fault of their own. We must attempt to reconstruct affected trains of thought via GUAC and the like to identify deviations and recorded and hypothetical risk tolerance violations.

continuous reevaluation of old trains of thought
Discovery phase (execution of scientific process) yields results with higher trust / TCB assurances
re-train
Kick off CI/CD/MLOps
The dionysian discovery method: shift left to high entropy (insanity) to re-check theories within previously unknown contexts given new data events which triggered re-eval which came from higher trust boundries

- TODO
  - [ ] Index federated data by entities which affected it so we can purge our cache as needed

## Notes for this draft tutorial

> Multi stage hermetic builds enable isolated dynamic analysis. We'll use the assets, operations, flows from Party Planning to think up the stage which sources pip index from earlier stages. This will lets Alice play with new ideas within an isolated (non distructive, no internet) connected environment.
