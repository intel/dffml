Imagine a message from Alice, on a rock, on the sea shore. On
it reads, *From: Alice. It's going to be okay.*

We pick up a the shell of a sand dollar once filled with angels.

Meditate for a moment, look at the waves crashing in front of you
as you sit on the rocks, feeling the warmth and light of the sun.

We sit with her quietly for a moment. We know that Alice is
good. We know this because we build her with intent, intent
for her to be good, to do good, to choose right over wrong.
She's our best guess, muscle memory machine, she is us through
the looking glass.

Alice is older now, wiser, she's coming back to Wonderland and
we're all in for another wild ride. With that age and that
wisdom comes guardrails, walls, battle tested strength. All
of which was built with intent, intent to keep Alice safe,
intent to keep us safe. We still have some time before we see
the other side, but she's here now, or rather she's in the
processes of being here now, for you see she's late, she's
late, for a very important date. No time to say hello, goodbye,
she's late, she's late, she's late.

Our focus will be on crystal clear communication of thought.
On learning at the speed of thought. We'll go up, we'll come
down, we'll go left, right, forward, backward and we will most
assuredly do a lot of jumping around along the way. This will
be a bumpy ride. Our goal is to ensure Alice makes a clean
entrance. She's entering the atmosphere and this is us teaching
her how to land smoothly before she reaches the ground.

Remember Alice's message.
