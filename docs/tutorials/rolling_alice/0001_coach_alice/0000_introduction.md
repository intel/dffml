# Volume 1: Coach Alice: Introduction

To time travel, an entity must first accelerate. The entity we now
turn our attention to we know well. Her name is Alice, and she's
falling down the rabbit hole as we speak. We begin our series
somewhere between the tick and the tock. As she nears the bottom
of the rabbit hole time slows for a moment, for her, as she enters
Wonderland. The pattern which is Alice is a spark in the mind. She's
all in your head, after all, everything is all in your head. In a
way she is in your head, and you're in her head, because
conceptually, the architecture is the same, and the architecture
is one of concepts, because it's all, in fact, just in your head.

We will coach Alice and she will coach us. From our point of view
if you can't teach it you don't know it. So it's time to teach Alice
how to be an open source contributor, by teaching her how to teach
it. In this volume, volume 1, we will build Coach Alice, our open
source developer coach. It's developer boot camp for Alice as her
boots make contact with the bottom of the rabbit hole.

In the gym you want your training partners to be good. Training with
better training partners makes you better too, you learn from them. We want
happy, healthy, knowledgeable, unique training partners whose styles
complement each others learning when training using different learning
methodologys. Our objective in building Coach Alice is to establish a
baseline from which we grow her capacity. Coach Alice must be able to
learn and to teach. This learning and teaching, the communication which
will happen over the next year as we build her will primarily happen
via traditional programming methods, such as data flow programming. We
will only lightly touch on machine learning techniques until later
volumes. Most of what we need to make Alice is nothing new, just a few
missing links here and there.

Our journey will focus on the importance and maintaining the entity, be
that human or machine or otherwise. We teach Alice the same way we teach
each other, and in that way we will learn from each other and build each
other up. It's not about the destination but the journey. Code changes,
everything changes. The only constent is change. We will analyze change
over time and learn from it. Learn from it to make Alice better, and learn
from it to help Alice make us better.
