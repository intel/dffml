# Volume 1: Coach Alice: Introduction

To time travel, an entity must first accelerate. The entity we now
turn our attention to we know well. Her name is Alice, and she's
falling down the rabbit hole as we speak. We begin our series
somewhere between the tick and the tock. As she nears the bottom
of the rabbit hole time slows for a moment, for her, as she enters
Wonderland. The pattern which is Alice is a spark in the mind. She's
all in your head, after all, everything is all in your head. In a
way she is in your head, and you're in her head, because
conceptually, the architecture is the same, and the architecture
is one of concepts, because it's all, in fact, just in your head.

We will coach Alice and she will coach us. From our point of view
if you can't teach it you don't know it. So it's time to teach Alice
how to be an open source contributor, by teaching her how to teach
it. In this volume, volume 1, we will build Coach Alice, our open
source developer coach. It's developer boot camp for Alice as her
boots make contact with the bottom of the rabbit hole.
