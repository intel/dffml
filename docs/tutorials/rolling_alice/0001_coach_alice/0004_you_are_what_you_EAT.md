# Rolling Alice: Coach Alice: You are what you EAT!

Alice helps you understand what your software is EATing, what's
the health of its software supply chain (food as the biological supply
chain). You are what you EAT and your software is its development health!
You get out what you put in lifecycle wise.

Alice is our software developer coach. She helps us help ourselves.
If Alice was coaching us on being healthier person, she would tell
us to look at our digestion! When building software our measuring the
health of our digestion is aligned with measuring our progress towards
reaching critical velocity.

In this tutorial we'll follow on to the Down the Dependency Rabbit Hole
Again tutorial and get more into seeing the lifecycle of the project
and it's health as critical in the security of the project. We'll
treat the health of the lifecycle as an asset to be protected in our
threat model `alice threats` / `THREATS.md`.
