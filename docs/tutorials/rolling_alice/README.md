# [Rolling Alice](https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/alice/docs/tutorials/rolling_alice/)

The following seven volumes describe Alice's next adventure as she
returns to Wonderland. Where's Wonderland? Well that's where we are,
the physical world. We'll travel through through time and space as we
watch her come into this world. We'll work with her and with each
other to build the best possible community we can. A community where
we have entered the fully connected development model.

In our community of the future, Alice will be seen as one of us,
another remote developer. We'll each have our own copies of Alice,
who can be named Bob, or Eve, or anything. All these entities will
be seen just like Alice, just like all of us. There will be no way
to tell which entities are human and which are machine.

They say you don't really know something until you can teach it.
If we understand how to be human we will be able to teach Alice
how to be human. Her thought process is a methodology for problem
solving which is based off a mental model of how the human mind
interacts with the world. Alice the architecture is just the
existing best known architecture, what use everyday, all the time.
Alice is the Open Architecture, she is the architecture of us all.
We'll learn from Alice, and Alice will learn from us as she comes
into our time.
