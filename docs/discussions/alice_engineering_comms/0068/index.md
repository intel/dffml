- So called "effective altruism movement" is not aligned
  - What you are now is what you are becoming.
  - Same goes for the collective.
- Example threat model scenario
  - Imagine a software security researcher named Alice.
  - Alice want wants to publicize her scientific research so
    as to engage in discourse in the community and further
    the [state of the art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_art).
    - Why she decided furthering the state of the art in field X
      is out of scope for this scenario. It would have been
      defined by reward mechanisms and the top level system
      context's gatekeeper and priroritizer. Alice may in this situation also be a tenant attempting to escape the sandbox of her top level system context‚Äôs multi tenant environment, she (sum of parts, inputs within context) herself a context.
  - Alice searches for communities to engage with, forums
    chats, activity, any signs of life in the conceptual field
    (the train of thought).
  - Alice's query yields a malicious attacker controlled community.
    - Acceleration in this community's train of thought is
      measured to be outside of acceptable impact bounds to her values
      / ethics / strategic principles and plans. She determines this by
      predicting future state.
  - How does Alice know that she should avoid working with
    unaligned entities? How did she determine it was detrimental
    to her strategic principles when viewed from lifecycle scope?
    - Traversal of trust graphs!

    - > Just think about it like üê¢ turtling in an RTS game or like being zen. You just don‚Äôt engage, you dont care, you‚Äôre focused with your alys in your ad hoc formed groups
    - open source community cross talk / innersource: example set CNCF projects are aligned trees from similar roots.
    - you look at other parts of your lifecycle to see how you can position yourself within the multi dimensional strategic field landscape which your top level strategic principles apply to within a context

  - [ ] analysis of kubernetes community handling of aligned events and community response to unaligned actors
