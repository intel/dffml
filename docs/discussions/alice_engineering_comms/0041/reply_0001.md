- Last time
  - Didn't get into threat model discussion
- Use cases
  - [Hardware / Microelectronics Use Case](https://github.com/ietf-scitt/use-cases/blob/main/hardware_microelectronics.md)
  - [DRAFT SBOM Use Case](https://github.com/rjb4standards/Presentations/raw/master/2022-0912-SBOM%20Use%20Case.pdf)
  - [DRAFT Software Supply Chain Artifact Examples](https://github.com/or13/use-cases/blob/59f8623abc3c351125fc097ac56cf88ae8ea2f1b/software_artifact_examples.md)
  - [DRAFT OpenSSF Metrics](https://github.com/pdxjohnny/use-cases/blob/openssf_metrics/openssf_metrics.md)
    - This is the one we're most closely (timeline wise) connected to.
- SBOM use case aligns closely with NIST guidelines
- What's in the registry
  - Is it the Signed SBOM itself? No, it's the attestation from the notary (gatekeeper)
    - The notary has the permissions to insert
  - What goes on chain is an assertion
- Consumers have no way to verify the digitality signed object 
  - They should be able to submit the digitality signed object (content addressable) a query registries and determine trust via inspection of notary claims within the registry.
  - To see if the entity has been registered
- Example: Produce new version of embed TLS
- SBOMs need to go in registry with other trusted data
  - We need many different factors in determining trust
  - We can insert more than just notarizations around SBOMs
- Orie: Let's focus on single registry use cases for now
  - Two permissions models we'll focus on
    - https://github.com/ietf-scitt/draft-birkholz-scitt-architecture/issues/25
    - Public read, private write
      - Probably more complex policies would be active here (closer to full R/W)
    - private read, private write
  - Policy layer
    - If inputs are always hashes, then how do you make sense of should you accept it or not?
    - If the claims are rich, the policy can be rich (in terms of what can be applied).
    - You might have to go to an auditor, then it's a private read scenarios (DID resolution with UCAN auth for example)
     - What kind of policy could we apply to claims, or might want to apply to claims
     - https://github.com/ietf-scitt/draft-birkholz-scitt-architecture/issues/26
- Situation where data is not notarized
  - Just sent as a package of requirements from end customer
    - We have to comply with their data requirements, customer maintains the trusted registry 
- On insert
  - Have to auth that signature on COSE sign 1 is from the entity from the header
  - COSE header tells you claims
  - Content Types tell you what the payload is
  - SCITT instance could use policy to validate

    - Alignment here with previous Open Architecture train of thought

- Receipts are a critical part of this
  - SCITT implementation is required to produce and independently verifiable cryptographic receipt
  - You get back a (effectively countersignature), its been registered, it's tamper proof
  - You don't have to query
    - It's then independently verifiable, it carries the proff with it
    - Its' in the draft 1 for the architecture and it's been in Sylvan Clebesch team's work implementation wise and in the draft of the receipts doc.

- Dick: Looking for agreement on:
  - Is there a
    - Notary?
    - Registry?
    - etc.
- Dick: Looking for agreement on objective function agreement:
  - Give consumers a means to verify a digitally signed object
  - It should include any claims that it is trustworthy
- Roy: All we know is it was valid at the time it was signed
  - Notary: Monty was Monty at the time you signed this
- Authenticode signs with two different signatures so if they have to they can revoke one and roll it
- Open Source Software
  - We'll be inserting things as we build them sometimes via self notarization
- Yogesh
  - Rebuilding binary exact would allow for others to notarize build process without attested compute
  - Fully Private
  - Fully Public
    - Designated roles have access
  - We don't want to restrict our work to a specific deployment
  - Notary has a role to play but we would like to make it a nice to have on to of existing
    - Revisit this, Roy and John see notery as critical
    - What are the levels of auditing we want to be done
    - I have a receipt, I know that it's policy has been met
    - What is the next level of auditing you want?
      - There may be compute or other cost associated with going another level deep of auditing.
- Monty: TCG forums have considerable interest in understanding firmware (TPM, etc.)
  - SBOM like "manifests"
- We are still focusing on software as the core use case.
  - When the right time comes, we can open the architecture to other ecosystems
  - The agreement at Philly was focus will be on software but we will architect it such that it could include hardware. We will when the right time comes
  - We are doing it in a generic way. it could be used in other scenarios, we want to not pidgin hole into one vertical.
- Orie: Defect in certain verifiable data systems (ones that log every interaction)
  - In certain high security systems even a read is a write!
    - This could be expensive in a public read scenario
  - Cost associated with cold storage evaluation raises interesting questions
    - Related to distributed compute

- Read receipt
  - I did a query at this point of time
  - Proof of the most recent read of something
  - Threat model: Is there a Time of Check Time of Use here?
    - What if you need proof someone did a read?
- TODO
  - [ ] Sequence diagram for Notary and Verifier
    - https://github.com/ietf-scitt/draft-birkholz-scitt-architecture/issues/27
  - [ ] @pdxjohnny: Update these notes with references to async tbDEX contract notes from Alice thread around audit level.
    - For future discussion 
  - [ ] Dick: Definition on mailing list for what we are hashing against (file data stream?)
    - Critical for content addressability
    - We need to be careful of hashing compressed or decompressed objects
