  - > [puerco](https://github.com/puerco): We don't have any at the moment, this week we started discussing some of the discovery/delivery means for OpenVEX data in the community call. It is not yet online on the OpenSSF youtube channel but be sure to check it out when it's uploaded (community meeting of Jun 12th). We are working on the tooling to publish OpenVEX data through repositories and OCI registries, but I'm sure the SIG would love to hear more ideas, please feel free to join and share your thoughts.

      - Sweet, see engineering logs ~month ago, we must still be on track
  - Awesome!! I appreciate you letting me know. Glad to hear others are going with OCI registries as well. https://oras.land/ tooling has been helpful.
