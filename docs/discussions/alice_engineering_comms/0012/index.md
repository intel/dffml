In summary, a NIST Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR) is an attestation
by a software vendor showing that the vendor has checked each component of a
software product SBOM for vulnerabilities and reports on the details of any
vulnerabilities reported by a NIST NVD search. The VDR is a living document
which the software vendor updates as needed when new vulnerabilities have
been discovered and reported. A VDR is published whenever a software vendor
issues a new or updated SBOM, including initial product release, making it
available online, all the time, to all customers of the product described in
the VDR. This gives software consumers that ability to answer the question
"What is the vulnerability status of my software product from Vendor V, as
of NOW?".”
