    - Does SCIIT/rekor fit in as the trust registry here?
    - > The mission of the ToIP Foundation is to define a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust that combines cryptographic trust at the machine layer with human trust at the business, legal, and social layers. The ToIP stack has two parallel halves—a technical stack and a governance stack—operating at four layers 1) Utility (DLT Blockchain), 2) Agent/Wallet, 3) Credential Exchange (Issuer/Verifier/Holder) and 4) Ecosystem (Application).  See further details in the ToIP white paper.
      >
      > A core role within ToIP Layer 4 is a trust registry (previously known as a member directory). This is a network service that enables a governing authority for an ecosystem governance framework (EGF) to specify what governed parties are authorized to perform what actions under the EGF. For example:
      >
      > - What issuers are authorized to issue what types of verifiable credentials.
      > - What verifiers are authorized to request what types of verifiable presentations.
      > - What other trust registries (and their governing authorities) are trusted by a host trust registry.
- TODO
  - [ ] Investigate for OpenSSF Metrics for Software Supply Chain/DID/DICE/KERI/SCITT/OpenArchitecture for evaluation of components while onboarding (Allowlist model example): https://sovrin.org/outlining-a-self-sovereign-approach-to-device-onboarding/
  - [ ] Example overlay which opens and adds a source to `CMD`
