## SCITT Reference Implementation

- Goal
  - Example graph for one use case
- Search engines auto query RDF JSONLD
  - VCs are in RDF by default so you get the graph for free
- Kiran from Microsoft, hardware background
- Orie from Transmute
- IETF goals are to define building blocks and keep it generic
- It makes sense to have a reference implementation
  - What level do we want?
    - Toy
    - Hosted
    - Ecosystem
- Let's build code along with the spec
- SCITT building blocks are so far out from sandardisation pro
- Fundamentally supply chain is about peices that interact
  - Best hting we can do is workshop
- Transmute is implementing examples to show SCITT will work for hardware as well
  - Orie will have some use cases which will have payloads which will have cliams which might be SBOMs
    - This way we both mention how SBOM would be a node in the graph so it helps us work out common use cases
- If we had these claims? What kinds of questions could we awnser
- How is an issuer releated to a software artifact, related to a CVe, in a couple example payload formats
- Intent to define example payloads and places to collect them
  - Let's have the converstatoin on the mailing list
  - Feedback may be that Payload specifics are out of scope for the work
  - We still what to talk about what kind of knowledge we want to represent with these opace payloads
  - We can start and OpenSSF Use Case doc
    - https://github.com/ietf-scitt/use-cases/issues/14
  - John to send out email to mailing list and add ID sec threatds group with to as Mike.
