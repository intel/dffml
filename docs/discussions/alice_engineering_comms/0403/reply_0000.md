- We need to build the dependency graph, KCP is our API layer for Alice. Federated events from SCITT will be transformed into `kubectl apply` YAMLs. GUAC query + evented graph exec + SCITT acts as a firewall for an instance of Alice. KCP, GUAC, forgego all compile to WASM, with the dependency graph of the projects a dev (Alice, Bob, a human, etc.) is working on we can make decisions on what we want to federate to their environment. We want to be able to run a forge in browser. WASM + WebML would make for sweet [EAT](https://github.com/intel/dffml/tree/main/docs/tutorials/rolling_alice/0000_architecting_alice#entity-analysis-trinity).
  - > [What’s in a controller?](https://book.kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/controller-overview#whats-in-a-controller)
    > Controllers are the core of Kubernetes, and of any operator.
    >
    > It’s a controller’s job to ensure that, for any given object, the actual state of the world (both the cluster state, and potentially external state like running containers for Kubelet or loadbalancers for a cloud provider) matches the desired state in the object. Each controller focuses on one root Kind, but may interact with other Kinds.
    >
    > We call this process reconciling.
    >
    > In controller-runtime, the logic that implements the reconciling for a specific kind is called a [Reconciler](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/reconcile?tab=doc). A reconciler takes the name of an object, and returns whether or not we need to try again (e.g. in case of errors or periodic controllers, like the HorizontalPodAutoscaler).
