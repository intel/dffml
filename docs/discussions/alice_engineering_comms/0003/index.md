  - > It is not just a matter of your software, it is a fundamental design question whether to maintain separation between the logical model and its serializations.  Maintaining separation shouldn't be a matter of personal preference, it's good software engineering.  The OWL Web Ontology Language https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/ has an excellent diagram illustrating the separation between semantics and syntax.  Several serializations are defined in OWL (Manchester Syntax, Functional Syntax, RDF/XML, OWL/XML, and Turtle), and more syntaxes have been added since (JSON-LD, RDF-star, ...).
