  - > [87prashant](https://github.com/87prashant): I was asking is this react-native-onyx project is built by Expensify from zero or earlier it was under some other account on github?
Actually, I was asking about this project from chatGPT and it gave this info that it is created by someone else(probably wrong😝). Btw thanks for replying
