# How Does W3C Work?

- W3C groups are chartered for a set amount of time
- https://w3c.github.io/did-use-cases/
   - WG will be focusing on interoperability
    - Ensure DID methods interoperate
    - Will try to define what does interoperability mean
    - Would be nice to have a schema for a did
    - Example: PKI Cert DID
      - Structure around how application would go about solving an authentication or authorization challenge
      - Could be made to work with zero knowledge proofs or other arbitrary methods
      - Point is largely to ensure you don't have to use centralized PKI
- Vol 3: Politics
  - Sometimes folks object to continuing a WG charter on pollical or philosophical groups
  - WG members sometimes raise concern of opponents charters concerns on the grounds they want to preserve currently advantageous positions held due to lack of standards.
