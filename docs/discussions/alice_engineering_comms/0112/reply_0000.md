- TODO
  - [ ] confidential containers anroid vm hangouts (refactor to voice) call center SCITT non virtual via emulated rust python qemu patchset set cr pinging for setup of memory regions for vmcs like config. RING -3 esq TEE validated in dataflow executiton env somiar to ipvm did merkle dag recent Zypher stuff signal signup for secure easy access comms video channel for data or exec proxy streams
    - This will be Alice’s phone. Recent laptop lockouts made clear the phone for better or for worse is the decafcto unit of compute if you want to emulate an end user. We can use browser via ui automater code which exists and will be pushed upstream. Thijs slso lets us use brave wallet’s. We can then instantiate N on demand with attestation for various use cases  grep debit card.
    - You could vtpm to a remote physical key hsm on usb

    - Implement graphql pagnation for backup then enable dataflow middleware on knowledge graph for transform pipeline config using Open Architecture and synthesize to workflow execution plus triggers if needed for deployment env (stream of consciousness dispatches in run deployment whereas creates repo with runners, v8 usermode linux runners for synthesis deployment) enable oa style callback on timeout / events all configurable by checking if event/timeout/callback system context is valid on register. This should take us to distributed execution once we query via graphql-ld, then do caching: locking network
