## LLM Based Debug of Creating Policy Engine Workflow for Repo CI Validation

> What OS (/usr/lib/os-release or /etc/os-release) am I on, what's it's package manager, what does the LLM think will move us from ad-hoc CVE of install failure to VEX of not affected for this branch in train of thought

- user: What dnf install commands do I need to issue?

The errors you are encountering are due to missing development libraries that are required to compile the Python extensions. Here are the necessary `dnf install` commands to install these libraries on a Fedora-based system:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y bzip2-devel ncurses-devel libffi-devel readline-devel sqlite-devel tk-devel xz-devel
```

After installing these libraries, you should reconfigure and recompile Python. Hereâ€™s a complete set of steps you can follow:

1. **Install the required libraries:**

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y bzip2-devel ncurses-devel libffi-devel readline-devel sqlite-devel tk-devel xz-devel
   ```

2. **Reconfigure and recompile Python:**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/Python-3.12.1
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully compile and install Python 3.12.1 with all necessary extensions.
