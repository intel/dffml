- Alice is Here! Itâ€™s the 2nd Party and everyone is invited ðŸ’ƒðŸ¥³. Alice is both the nickname for the Open Architecture, the methodology of description of any system architecture, as well as the entity defined using that description of architecture. She is *the entity and the architecture.*

- What to expect
  - Alice ready for contribution
    - Completed: 2022-07-29
    - [Coach Alice Our Open Source Guide](https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rolling_alice/0001_coach_alice/0002_our_open_source_guide.md)
    - [General Alice Contribution Docs](https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/main/entities/alice/CONTRIBUTING.rst#tutorials)
  - We'll be rebasing this branch into main once the CI for 2ndparty plugin support passes (see closed PR with ADR, only closed because of branch rewrite to remove images, will be reopened asap).
    - ETA: 2023-06-01
  - We'll then rewrite history again, splitting the plugins out into their respective 2ndparty maintenance locations (dffml or builtree org or possibly other option on stay with 2ndparty within intel org, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see how it goes pending governance review).
    - ETA: 2023-11-30
  - Finally, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll flip the switch to our web5 world, where git is only used as a proxy for commit data encoded via DIDs. We will then have ourstory, from then on everything will be Alice. Alice will be the methodology by which we interpret those nodes, DIDs in the web5 case. Alice will also exist as the entity whose execution is based on the same methodology used for definition of the graph.

    - [ ] Later for operations the schema is the schema for the associated manifest.
  - [x] Split overlays into separate file locations
    - [x] Update Alice contributing docs with new paths instead of AliceGitRepo omport from alice.cli
  - [ ] Docs build with `alice` branch if working
  - [ ] Run auto formatter on every commit in alice branch
  - [ ] Cloud development environment options
    - Public

      - [x] How to extend recommended community standards command with overlays
        - Basic tutorial where we grab the name from a configuration file
      - [ ] Show me a security overlay.
        - Write section of our open source guide tutorial where we implement the SECURITY.md overlay
        - Latwr go back and write how we implemented the base flow and the initial set of overlays, and the readme overlay.
          - We can prototype the use of commit messages as docs and commit the whole file when we move it with docs for that overlay, rST in commit message. Later explore log of file to changelog in rST to sphinx docs.
          - Link up with herstory to ipynb creation and shell command saving. Auto generate commit messages (docs) based on herstorical shell commands ran (or if in vscode debug buttons or run buttons executed) with output. Diff system context herstory state with link in chain at last clean tree. Run timeline resolution if dirty tree for set of commits (multiple git add runs). First we automate writing the docs, then we automate reading.
      - [ ] How to write new commands
      - [ ] Non CLI interfaces
  - [ ] Physical party - TBD probably 2029, 2030
  - [ ] Commenting in issue while debugging, this is an overlay to herstory collection
  - [ ] Get tbDEX up and running for backing storage
    - [ ] Write an operation that inserts data into tbDEX format, either via API or flat file duplication of formatting via libraries like the Python peerdid library.
  - [ ] Use @programmer290399's QA model to implement `alice ask` which queries all our docs, logs, notes, issues, etc.
    - https://programmer290399.github.io/pyqna/usage.html
- Alice enables granular identification and application of static or dynamic policy.
  - She does this through context aware overlays whose application process to upstream may be dynamic, even in part end user (attacker) flows, which can be executed or synthesized within an appropriate (optionally adaptive, we do dynamic and static and we understand time across so we can come re synthesize in your codebase on trigger) sandbox
