From Claude:

Here is one way I could expand the Python implementation in more detail:

```python
# Alice class
class Alice:

  def __init__(self):
    
    # Initialize secure DID
    self.did = create_did_keypair()  
    self.did.register()

    # Set up event subscriptions
    self.subscriptions = []
    self.subscribe_to_events(criteria="git") 

    # Prioritizer tracks priority of potential actions
    self.prioritizer = Prioritizer()

    # Knowledge graph tracks what Alice knows
    self.knowledge = KnowledgeGraph()

  def on_event(self, event):
    
    # Update knowledge graph
    self.knowledge.ingest(event)

    # Check relevance
    if self.is_relevant(event):
      
      # Summarize changes
      changes = self.summarize(event)

      # Get priority for potential actions
      priority = self.prioritizer.get_priority(changes)

      # Determine action based on priority
      action = self.decide(priority)

      # Execute action
      if action == "notify":
        self.notify(changes)

      elif action == "think":
        self.think(changes)

  def is_relevant(self, event):
    """Relevance check using metadata like source DID"""
    return event.source in self.trusted_sources

  def summarize(self, event):
    """Extract key info from event"""
    return event.extract_summary()

  def decide(self, priority):
    """Pick action based on priority"""
    if priority > NOTIFY_THRESHOLD:
      return "notify"
    else:
      return "think"
    
  def notify(self, changes):
    """Send notification to user"""
    print(f"Notifying about: {changes}")

  def think(self, changes):
    """Further process changes"""
    print(f"Thinking about: {changes}")

# Bob class
class Bob():
  
  def __init__(self):
    self.did = create_did_keypair()
    self.did.register()

  def on_change(self):
    
    changes = detect_changes()
    
    # Create signed event
    event = create_event(changes)
    event.sign(self.did)

    # Publish event
    self.publish(event)

  def publish(self, event):
    """Publish event to DID resolver"""
    self.did.resolve().publish(event)

# Event bus

class EventBus:

  def receive(self, event):
    
    # Route event to subscribers
    for sub in self.subscribers:
      sub.on_event(event)

# Usage

alice = Alice() 
bob = Bob()

bus = EventBus()
bus.subscribers.append(alice)

# Bob detects and publishes a change
bob.on_change() 

# Bus routes event to Alice
bus.receive(event)
```

This expands on the core logic to show:

- More lifecycle around initializing Alice's DID, knowledge, and subscriptions
- Bob creating signed events
- Publishing events to a DID resolver
- Alice's knowledge graph and prioritizer for reasoning about events  
- More detailed event bus for pub/sub routing

Let me know if you would like me to focus on expanding any particular area further!
