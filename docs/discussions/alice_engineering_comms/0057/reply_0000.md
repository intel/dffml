    - > mvfst-rl is a framework for network congestion control in the QUIC transport protocol that leverages state-of-the-art in asynchronous Reinforcement Learning training with off-policy correction.
- GitHub Actions
  - https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko#running-kaniko-in-docker
    - See if updating the `build_images_containers.yml` works if we add these volume mounts and so forth.
    - There may have been an OCI image issue. Maybe we can rebuild and push in docker format?
      - Lets just switch to podman or docker onstead of kaniko because we know that works on actions
- Container Registry
  - Provide on demand image builds where final layers are just added staticlly
    - https://github.com/ImJasonH/kontain.me
      - https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/a0f66878d01286cac42d99fb45e3b335710c00a5/pkg/v1/random/image.go
  - These layers then have their SBOM added where they have provenance as the data provenance for the addition of the layer
  - Then we have content addressability and SBOM and provenance from sigstore etc. via existing registry interoperability tooling
  - Compute contracts can be issued by having the pull from the registry be authed by verifiable credential
    - Registry releases content addressable verifiable with SCITT recpit of release (because data might be sensitive, need confirmed release in case of need to revoke / roll keys)
- Created DigitalOcean space data.nahdig.com
  - data.nahdig.com is for data with suspect provenance
  - No `.` in any names in DO spaces! Certs will fail!
    - We have taken no steps to think about hardening on OS DecentrAlice yet within context of scanning
    - We should assume VM compromise, aka, data is best effort
      - Hence nahdig
      - Data from systems with provenance and hardening will be served from data.chadig.com
