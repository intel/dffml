  - Here is an example of using a file (workflow) as a payload: https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/alice/docs/tutorials/rolling_alice/0000_architecting_alice/0002_shes_ariving_when.md#scitt-api-emulator-spin-up

- https://github.com/credential-handler/credential-handler-polyfill#demo
  - Summary of end-to-end demo of secure build to boot to usage
    - We'll want `did:keri` support for the end-to-end flow where we have software built within a TEE with KERI tied to the TEE's hardware root of trust.
    - We'll export SCITT to a flat file format, we'll send it to the browser
    - The browser will be able to auth to the software stack by pulling down the git repos involved and matching up the transparency service receipts/records with the git repos.
      - Fully isolated (SLSA4+) setup
        - This cuts out like, most of the way everything is done today in software.

- TODO
  - [ ] Add `FROM scratch` image examples
    - [ ] Add schema to output for the flow based on `Definition`s at `/schema.json`
      - Use `@context` with zeroith index pointing to a manifest ADR schema
        - Example: https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/alice/schema/github/actions/build/images/containers/0.0.0.schema.json
  - [ ] Find Source URL -> CVE mapping code as example of depth of field mapping in action

    - @Cat-Katze Just FYI, this tutorial, which is meant to be the creation of a basic/high-level threat model from a Software Bill Of Materials, is closely related to the https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/issues/2639 activity. We'll eventually use the threat model plus the triage mechanism together as we preform automated vuln analysis.
      - For more background, the https://github.com/ietf-scitt/use-cases/issues/14 is about how we can have the transparency service, which will be the source of truth for "is CVE-XYZ a vuln that affects product ABC" can interact with CI/CD systems to trigger auto triage per federated CI/CD eventing: https://codeberg.org/forgejo-contrib/discussions/issues/12. Since Open Source Software projects have different threat models based on how they might be deployed, each project will get an event, "new vuln!" when there is a new vuln. The downstream projects (projects which use a project, for example: dffml-model-tensorflow is downstream of DFFML) will get notifications of new vulns, the hope is we can bake in a pattern of analysis which can be followed as vulns cascade downstream for analysis / remediation within different contexts per their usage.
