    - > We donâ€™t support asyncio for remote tasks. The following snippet will fail:

  - This looks like a good base for dataflow diff of cached flows to support resumeablity (cattle as pets)
- TODO
  - [ ] Finish pipdeptee and output via datalfow cache dump to json
    - #596
    - Update packages to include main package (dffml)
  - [ ] Build dataflows from dependency trees
    - [ ] Container build flows for each plugin
      - This will be the basis for the granular diamond/pyramid pattern validation
    - [ ] Test flows take build flows as inputs `run_plugin_tests(plugin_image_container: str)` (can be overriden via dynamic context aware overlay, this also means for audit which is the more likely case)
  - [ ] Execute "locally" via k8s job runner
  - [ ] Synthesis to GitHub Actions workflows via templates
  - [ ] Trigger workflows via URL request
  - [ ] Spin runners on devcloud via webhook and validate plugins via Python 3.9 DFFML container

    - How clean can we make the infra and POC for VEX, SBOM, VDR base for next pytss example by Friday?
