- Application of software supply chain security practices to AI/ML models and data, recently demo'd some work at IETF 118 [SCITT](https://scitt.io/) WG meeting on federation of new (signed) statements (in AI/ML case these may be trust attestations for trust in model or data) added to Transparency Service's (TS) append only log: https://github.com/scitt-community/scitt-api-emulator/blob/72a75511d7840d4062741185ec6879b585ee8c07/docs/federation_activitypub.md#federation-via-activitypub
  - Future downstream work of this includes ingestion of federated TS statements who's subjects may result in re-training, re-deployment, allow/denylisting of models, data, embeddings.
