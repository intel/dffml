    - > meanwhile at work, a thing i've been working on for the past few months has dropped: https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/accelerate-vex-adoption-through-openvex it's basically like ActivityStreams, but for security vulnerability data sharing. with a little bit of work, we can lift up to something more like ActivityPub for real-time collaboration, a blog is forthcoming about it.

  - > TIL there's a technical name for why ideas happen in the shower: the "default mode network" is a pattern of brain activity, measurable using fMRI, that happens when we're unfocussed. When the brain goes into idle mode (reduced activity), this part of the brain actually becomes *more* active. What does the default mode network do? Research is ongoing, but part of it definitely seems to be making connections, which is associated with *curiosity and creativity*.

      - sqlite to endpoint
      - Could maybe do linked data?
        - Could we go from CVE Bin Tool database (`--nolock`) to OpenVEX via a plugin for datasette?
        - Could we loop againt the db with nolock to publish events during scan from seperate process? Would have to do db writes more often?
