 ## 2023-02-27 SCITT

- Moved architecture repository to https://github.com/ietf-wg-scitt/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture
- CODEOWNERS (teams usage do not provide traceability, explicitly managed within files)
- Transparency service, TS, registry, all same words, cleaned up a bit
  - Transparency Service is what we are going with
  - https://github.com/ietf-wg-scitt/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture/pull/16
    - Converge claim and statement
- Example
  - Steve is submitting information about an ubuntu release to the TS
  - Steve's identity used to write to TS (RBAC auth on this)
    - eNotary is validating Canonical's Ubuntu Signature
- The duty of the transparency service is not to detect lies
  - It does have some registration process
  - There can be a gatekeeper function which limits use of transparency service
    - This is the policy which constrains what the notary can place in the service
      - Minimum could be content type, what is allowed to write to the product line
        - This policy engine is outside the scope of SCITT
          - This is what facilitates trust propagation in our recursive grafted log setup
        - https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/issues/2639
    - This could just be an admit
      - Could be based on RBAC of the product
        - #1400
- Notary maintaining append only ledger
  - Notary says identity of signature is correct
    - The notary check the identity was valid when signature happens
  - It's not the notaries job to say it's an incorrect contract
    - It doesn't check that the SBOM is an accurate representation of the software
  - Is digital signature valid?
    - TS can decide if it wants to accept different identities or types of identities
      - Policy on given instance could say
        - X509 notarizations for these content types
        - Was it revoked?
- Receipt generator
  - KERI Watcher
  - https://github.com/microsoft/scitt-ccf-ledger
    - SCITT Emulator
  - https://transparency.dev/
    - Centralized, SigStore
- What happens when hardware fails? How does new logs come online
- John: Recursive downstream policy for VEX
  - Roy: There is an issue with propagation times
  - John: It sounds like you have insights on the VEX use case. Is there somewhere I can find more details about what you're looking at for that propagation issue?
- [Roy](roywill@microsoft.com)
  - Says there is some propagation delay we need to deal with to propagate VEX
