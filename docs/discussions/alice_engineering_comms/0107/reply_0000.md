  - At least the point as it is the point*er* to the current state of the art train of thought.
  - Hmmm, maybe the ADHD is just the amplification over the baseline and we just aren't seeing that the baseline has already been amplified to a level where we are loosing sight of our function in the body (so to speak, celestially *ba dum tss*).

      - > Upside down reinforcement learning (UDRL) flips the conventional use of the return in the objective function in RL upside down, by taking returns as input and predicting actions. UDRL is based purely on supervised learning, and bypasses some prominent issues in RL: bootstrapping, off-policy corrections, and discount factors. While previous work with UDRL demonstrated it in a traditional online RL setting, here we show that this single algorithm can also work in the imitation learning and offline RL settings, be extended to the goal-conditioned RL setting, and even the meta-RL setting. With a general agent architecture, a single UDRL agent can learn across all paradigms.

  -  > #### F.11 Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) Plan Submission
    > To ensure Contractors remain aware of and are implementing emerging SCRM requirements over the life of the Contract, a SCRM Plan will be submitted to the Program Manager no later than 30 calendar days after the end of each contract year. Refer to NIST SP 800-161 for a plan template. Additional artifacts may also be required. The Contractor shall ensure that Executive Order 14028 and its associated NIST SP 800-53 controls are considered flow-down requirements for subcontractors, including commercial item subcontractors. Finally, consent to subcontract at the TO level may also consider subcontractor SCRM requirements.
