  - TXT
    - We frequently skip talking about this in this thread to avoid too much acronym soup, but TPMs are only good for https://github.com/intel/dffml/tree/main/docs/arch/0007-A-GitHub-Public-Bey-and-TPM-Based-Supply-Chain-Security-Mitigation-Option.rst, aka tying keys into known hardware, without TXT (at least as we've been talking about them here). We just usually either talk about TPMs or TDX in this thread to illustrate the ends of the spectrum.
    - Trusted eXecution exTensions and Boot Guard combined with also a TPM (or a virtual equivalent) enables attested compute (by way of Secure Boot)

        - > [Attesting TPM-Protected Keys](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/tpm-usage/#attesting-tpm-protected-keys)
If an RSA private key has been generated in the TPM and has always been non-migratable, then the key may be certified by a key that has been verified as an Attestation Identity Key (AIK). No key, including any AIK, is certified unless the user or device-owner has consented to remote attestation of his or her device. A certified key credential gives very strong assurance that the key is protected by a Chrome Device TPM.
          > 
          > [Attesting Device Mode](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/tpm-usage/#attesting-device-mode)
At boot time, the read-only firmware extends TPM PCR0 with the status of the developer and recovery mode switches. The value of PCR0 can later be quoted using a key that has been verified as an Attestation Identity Key (AIK). The quote, in combination with the AIK credential, gives assurance that the reported PCR0 value is accurate. While assurance of the PCR0 value is very strong, assurance that this correctly reflects the device mode is weaker because of the reliance on read-only firmware to extend PCR0. It is nonetheless useful for reporting policy compliance. This PCR0 quote is not available outside of Chrome OS unless the user or device-owner has consented to remote attestation of the device.

- https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events
  - This looks like good rebroadcast material
- https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html
- We want to transform from ActivityPub incoming event (`@context|$schema` from node `inReply(d)To`) into event stream for alternate execution by worker nodes attached to context local message queue.
- Job URL -> hash -> mapping of lookup results from job URL as content address which resolves to results in oras.land
  - Just add the job URL hash as a tag and resolve via pulling that tag from the registry
- https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/rabbitmq.html
- https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/tutorials/task-cookbook.html
- https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/django/first-steps-with-django.html#using-celery-with-django
- We can enable ActivityPub as a database for celery and then we have parity between GitHub Actions as execution environment for ideation and prototyping compute. Then we have standard protocol and library to manage task queue execution based on inputs as schema/context inReplyTo events.
  - We can then run fully decoupled
- https://gvisor.dev/docs/tutorials/knative/
  - Wait we're supposed to be doing KCP almost forgot
- Run some live ones in https://github.com/cloudfoundry/korifi via `dffml-service-http`
  - Demo similar job URL hash as registry tag based addressing of results within registry
  - Enable sending of AcivityPub events directly (later) or indirectly via proxy nodes (first, activitypub starter kit.

- So no matter where you're executing, all the reporting and eventing is the same, because we are loosely coupled.
  - We can do `fromjson` in jq or we can do more advanced xargs chaining on the websocket for ad-hox dev work
  - We can shot from the activitypub inbox receiver to a message queue for integration with existing celery
  - This way we sidestep all rate limiting except for when we have to preform write events to GitHub
  - Otherwise we always read GitHub data from cypher queries over the reboardcast data
    - We can also have listeners which reboardcast the resolved contents of content address style broadcast data (the top level, so if this sees a container image uri broadcast, it would be pulling it down and maybe rebroadcasting the `results.yaml` or whatever is they transform needed to rebroadcast that data.
    - This is our onramp into the linked data space, eventually KERI for backing comms security

- https://github.com/comunica/jQuery-Widget.js/blob/master/config/config-default.json
- We need to turn the stream into something we can query using cypher or graphql-ld

- https://oras.land/blog/gatekeeper-policies-as-oci-image/
- https://github.com/project-zot/zot
- Okay if we can make the KERI SCITT instance use the OCI upload/download spec and then align the telemetry and registry federation protocols
  - Look into existing registry federation protocol if exists
- https://s3hh.wordpress.com/2022/10/27/oci-based-linux/
  - Similar goals to OS DecentrAlice

- https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#endpoints
- https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/issues/388
  - Have we thought about federation protocols / APIs? To enable registries to propagate uploaded content within a network of registries? Looking to come up to speed on any existing discussion if that's been touched on. Thank you!

      - Looked here for relevant paths here but not seeing anything that looks like it's for notifications / inbox style eventing
    - https://github.com/sapcc/keppel
    - https://github.com/ietf-scitt/use-cases/issues/14
      - Hoping we can align to similar federation protocols across transparency services and container registries so event stream consumers can work with the same protocol for each (ActivityStreams/Pub?)

- https://github.com/sapcc/keppel/blob/master/docs/api-spec.md#post-keppelv1authpeering
  - Looks like they have their own spec for federation, maybe we can implement with ActivityPub?
    - Maybe we can leverage the existing APIs similar to the /admin endpoint and just add in the activitypub endpoints for activitystreams / linked data notifications
- https://github.com/sapcc/keppel/blob/master/docs/example-policy.yaml
- We can take one manifest and make it into another one for execution via a different mechanism
  - Similar to the CLI overlays
    - https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/c82f7ddd29a00d24217c50370907c281c4b5b54d/entities/alice/alice/please/contribute/recommended_community_standards/cli.py#L60-L72
  - This is also similar to how we can decouple TODO logging from content for `alice please log todos`
    - Operation to generate TODO body
    - Operation for logging the TODO (write to GitHub)
  - Similar to a mutation of the propagated event into something context local relevant
    - Yes this vuln affects due to instance policy relevant threat model overlays or not
