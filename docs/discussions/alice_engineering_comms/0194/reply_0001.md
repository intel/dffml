  - Related: https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/596
- Alma and debian
  - Firefox delta
  - #789
- Manager to search across modules
- CSAIF directory so others can get them
  - Data consistency in the wild is suboptimal
    - Version numbers? Why can't we use PURL, etc.
- CSAIF is doesn't look like it's about to align with Cyclone in the future
- OpenVEX
  - Sudden release
  - Walled release process
  - Doesn't have most of the information we need
- Cylone VEX which cve-bin-tool supports
- SPDX is stalled for their VEX
- We need a way to say should you be worried about this vuln?
  - THERE IS NO WAY TO MAKE THIS DECERNATION WITHOUT THE DEPLOYMENT CONTEXT!
- Cyclone might evolve OBOM for arch links
  - Threat model overlays
- How could we do events of new vulns?
  - [RFCv2: IETF SCITT: Use Case: OpenSSF Metrics: activitypub extensions for security.txt](https://github.com/ietf-scitt/use-cases/blob/22afd537180d6c6b2d5ec4db0096f0706cb2b6bc/openssf_metrics.md)
- People started petitioning NVD to downscore CVSS
- What are reasons for not patching?
  - Threat model business objectives says strategic plan says out of scope
    - Downstream propagate? No! Overlay for my context says we're running this sandboxed and it's critical, propigate affected instead of not affected to this TS
- Hardware and infra is not all up to date in the wild!
  - Some people MUST run Windows NT! If they don't their business stops running
  - Upgrade paths a MUST, layered protection level / ring increase with higher level TCB
- Users will always find interesting ways to use things, THREATS.md
- What if we don't have a threat model from the original author?
  - Correctness? Review system baked in, this is our `vuln is bug` type fundamentally
  - https://forums.lutris.net/
- Can we talk to consumers?
  - Neither of us know what consumers of 
  - How do you facilitate the competitive market and innovation?
    - Open Source / Inner Source style encouragement to share?
- Anthony has also worked on Open Architecture (different thing, same name)
- If you submit a vuln, we should assume reported to will do nothing
  - Unless there is reviews saying they respond to vulns, but we should wait our default period before reporting anyway
- How can we leverage federated machine learning to do audit and analysis?
- Focus on getting eco system working with some major projects, k8s, some OSes, you'd want a stack
- You'll never have no vulns
  - If you have no vulns you're a dead project
    - Learning is growing
    - Are the vulns getting better or worse?
      - This is what we care about, acceleration
      - As long as versioned learning says you're within bounds, keep going!
- Want to enable users to make trust determinations
- Trust levels (protection rings)
- GitHub sounds open to partnership to make things better if we think of anything to talk to them about
