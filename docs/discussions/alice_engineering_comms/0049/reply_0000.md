Alice is you. What do you have access too?
- webrtc media stream of desktop
  - extension in browser
  - search
- vetting of information (gatekeeper/prioritizer)
- codegen synthesis
- offline RL
  - copy on write dataflow / system contexts for strategic plan evaluation for RL training on those predicted outputs
- start with max_ctxs=1

You ask codegen in generic terms for the prompt then you use open architecture plus codegen trained on open architecture to build deployments: system contexts, sometimes with overlays applied.\\

We don't need codegen, to progress on this thought, it's just the


Everything is an operation. See thread, what are all the parameter sets its been called with before. We add feedback by enabling dynamic dataflow.auto_flow / by_origin called on opimpn run of gather inputs and operations.

This would be sweet in something as fast as rust. Could allow for rethinking with everything as operations and dataflow as class off the bat
