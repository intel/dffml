- Submit claim for signature by notary
  - Notary checks for receipts from needed sign offs
    - In this example the SCITT instance the notary inserting into it have the same insert/sign policies (system context, dataflow, open architecture document, living threat model)
      - Alice thinks: I'd like to do this sign op and insert into this SCITT
        - She auths to SCITT via OIDC, she proves she had a valid token because she's issued a receipt. The whole process is wrapped up inside an enclave which runs within a parallel job. The enclave is then dumped at the end of the job so that it can be joined to an other transparency services. This enables decentralized hermetic builds.
    - The notary is what's verifying the OIDC token.
      - We can runs-on an SGX machine to do that.
      - Using confidential compute and attribute based trust we can authenticate to a usage policy, this is the contract negotiation.
  - Activity Pub Actors for signoff, you toot at them, they say okay I'll add this exception sign off for this use case /system context to SCITT
    - Then policy violating system context collects all needed exception receipts, listens for their entry via listening to the SCITT ActivityPub stream, and then re-issues request for admissions along with exception receipts using overlay section of serialized system context object
