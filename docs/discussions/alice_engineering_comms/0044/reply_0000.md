- TODO
  - [ ] Update 2nd Party ADR with example downstream validation across DFFML 3rd party plugin sets where compute access may be restricted to maintainers within those ad-hoc formed organziations (the repo owners).
  - [ ] Reuse SPDX Change Proposal template for DFFML
    - https://github.com/spdx/change-proposal
  - [ ] `.github/workflows/alice_shouldi_contribute.yml` add input which is list of overlays which are anything passable to `pip install` as an argument via command line `pip install` interface (rather than requirements.txt limitations), call via reusable workflow using SLSA demos.
    - This gives us arbitrary execution of metric collection with any overlays with provenance for runtime and therefore data and models downstream.

      - https://github.com/ietf-scitt/use-cases/issues/14
    - As a follow on to the OpenSSF Metrics use case document and

      will cover how we identify and query provenance on dependencies where caching
      on data flow execution is assisted via querying public SCITT infrastructure
      and sourcing cached state from trustworthy parties.

Re: [SCITT] Responding to Roy's request to stimulate discussions on hashing
Orie Steele <orie@transmute.industries> Mon, 03 October 2022 13:50 UTC[Show header](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/scitt/LjKVVNldjFnFLjtUTyPawTIaC0I/#)

We have a weekly meeting regarding this:
https://github.com/mesur-io/post-quantum-signatures

There are a few challenges that prevent us from using Dilithium, Falcon or
SPHINCs today, vs using LMS or XMSS (which have their own challenges, being
stateful).

The key integration point for us is COSE_Key and COSE_Sign / Counter Sign.

If you are interested in helping with COSE representations for PQC
signatures, we could use more contributors / reviews / PRs.

Regards,

OS
