  - ❤️❤️❤️ FUCK YES FUCK YES FUCK YES MOTHERFUCKER FUCK YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rust orchestrator?

    - https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/44
  - I wonder if this (authentication:true) might be a place where the https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/ spec could be used to specify the requirements around authentication. We could imagine a world where scorecard probes are hosted as microservices executed as an IPVM affect. Just spitballin here. In our hypothetical example we’d be looking at a CycloneDX dataflow of scorecard itself, attempting to execute the probes via IPVM.
  - Pulled Brooklyn and Laurent into the same thread. SBOM, OpenSSF, IPVM. We could even invoke probes via vuln submitted schema / protobuf
  - If we get good discussion then such-alignment doge meme
- https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/1421#issuecomment-1484110108
  - Mentioned we should serialize to CycloneDX format
    - What a wonderful day :) !!!

  - Steve recommends opening a new issue for further discussion. Ideally we discuss there and then align across those specs and in-toto. We need to sync with the Confidential Computing Consortium folks as well.
