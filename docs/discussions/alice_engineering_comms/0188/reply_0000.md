- Something about the pinning #906
  - [Rolling Alice: Architecting Alice: Introduction and Context](https://github.com/intel/dffml/tree/alice/docs/tutorials/rolling_alice/0000_architecting_alice#rolling-alice-volume-0-introduction-and-context)
    - Together we'll build Alice the AI software architect. We'll be successful when Alice successfully maintains a codebase as the only maintainer for a year. *Debugging issues, writing fixes, reviewing code, accepting pull requests, refactoring the code base post PR merge, dealing with vulnerabilities, cutting releases, maintaining release branches, and completing development work in alignment with the plugin's living threat model* (leveraging the [Open Architecture](https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/alice/docs/arch/0009-Open-Architecture.rst)). *She will modify, submit pull requests to, and track upstreaming of patches to her dependencies to achieve the cleanest architecture possible.* We'll interact with her as we would any other remote developer.
  - Fork

      - Reached out to this community again since we know about them already
      - We've been playing with ActivityPub as one option to enable multiple workers to provide feedback via `inReplyTo` and threads, mimicking human behavior. Wasn't sure where else to post so posting here. The hope is that our models can collectively respond, and the user or users AI agent can sift through and find the responses that are most helpful to them within the context of the conversation. Something like ActivityPub based communication (Rapunzel, ATProto come to mind) would enable folks AI's to collaboratively provide their responses.
