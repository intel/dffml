  - > This self-attestation form identifies the minimum secure software development requirements a software producer must meet, and attest to meeting, before their software subject to the requirements of M-22-18 may be used by Federal agencies. This form is used by software producers to attest that the software they produce was developed in conformity with specified secure software development practices.
    >
    > The following software requires self-attestation:
    >
    > - 1. Software developed after September 14, 2022;
    > - 2. Existing software that is modified by major version changes (e.g., using a semantic versioning schema of Major.Minor.Patch, the software version number goes from 2.5 to 3.0) after September 14, 2022; and
    > - 3. Software to which the producer delivers continuous changes to the software code (such as software-as-a-service products or other products using continuous delivery/continuous deployment).
