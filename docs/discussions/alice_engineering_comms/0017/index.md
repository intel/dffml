- SCITT
  - Explainer on IETF Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust (SCITT) working group
    - The proposed SCITT charter sets two goals:
      - Standardize the overall security flows for securing a software supply chain, covering the essential building blocks that make up the architecture, and
      - specify these building blocks, employing the existing work already done within other IETF WGs such as COSE WG, and IETF RATS WG, as appropriate.
    - This is an example Use Case doc: https://github.com/ietf-scitt/use-cases/blob/main/hardware_microelectronics.md which might help as a quick primer to help understand what SCITT is about.
    - Here is the draft SCITT charter for background: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-scitt/
    - Here is the draft SCITT architecture: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-birkholz-scitt-architecture/
    - Here is a recent mailing list email with more context: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/scitt/ZefYIxvkC_I-sgXETVoJeaYwFB4/ 
    - The charter has been currently scoped to software, but there are folks thinking about how it could be extended to other areas following implementation for software.
    - We're looking at a combination of SCITT plus overlays for threat modeling and policy as we analyze and communicate data on the software lifecycle for the OpenSSF Identifying Security Threats / Metrics WGs.
