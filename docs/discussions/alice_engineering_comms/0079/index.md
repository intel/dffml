- IPVM meeting tomorrow on content addressable execution

  - See recent notes on content addressable `serviceEndpoint` defined via dataflows pinned by `did:merkle:`
  - https://atproto.com/guides/data-repos
- Zephyr
  - What is at the top of the build parameter hierarchy
    - They use a Kconfig system
    - They could use overlays for this
  - Firmware build because it's embedded it more build time configs
    - How do we organize storage?
      - The Knowledge graph and data flows to link to describe those other flat structures
    - Need unique build ids
      - `did:merkle:` of serialized Open Architecture
  - They only ever run a few subsets of Kconfig parameter sets (a few parameters)
    - Parameters are any inputs that can effect the build
      - Tool chain version
  - Marc's example
    - Let's say I care about, git version ,tool chain version, various .config
      - https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pull/51954#issuecomment-1302983454
    - I track those for reproducability (and caching) information
    - When I want to generate a content addressable build I take all those JSON files (which are the generic graph serisalization of all the stuff you care about) you concat and checksum (`did:merkle:`).
