  - > "These phenomena are consistent with the notion of a ‘we-mode,’ in which interacting agents share their minds in a collective fashion and facilitate interaction by accelerating access to the other’s cognition." This shows brain scans from the study. Overview of the experimental setup used to study brain synchronization during cooperative tasks. (I) Participants had to design the interior of a digital room together, and a computer vision system kept track of their gaze to pinpoint the social behavior of looking at the other participant’s face. (II) The participants also completed the same task individually. (III) While they completed the experiment, their brain activity was recorded. Statistical analysis was then used to assess between-brain and within-brain synchronization of various cerebral regions. Credit: Xu et a

  - > This is interesting - many thanks Hannes. I notice our spec includes Merkle trees as the database structure - seems like an implementation detail, i.e. just a database. Can an implementer use, for e xample, an otherwise secured and RBAC'd record structure such as a file system or relational/hierarchical/sharded db, or is distributed ledger mandatory?

Has anyone been playing with federation of SCITT logs? Have been mocking up
some ActivityPub based stuff here, pretty rough right now but hopefully
will have actionable demos soon:
https://github.com/pdxjohnny/use-cases/blob/openssf_metrics/openssf_metrics.md#activitypub-extensions-for-securitytxt

The plan is to attach SCITT receipts to the ActivityPub posts for now. This
is just one option since there is a pretty solid existing ActivityPub
ecosystem. Would love more DID method native comms just haven't been able
to grok that yet to write up something similar with that stack.

Hoping to enable federation in the emulator and other implementations after
this implementation decoupled demo works.
