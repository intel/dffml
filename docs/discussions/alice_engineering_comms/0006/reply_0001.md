- Folks will be in Philly on Thursday for meeting
  - There is a remote link (see mailing list?) for the Thursday meeting
- Typical global warming centric chit chat
- Others at RATs meeting or busy with other IETF activities
- Introductions
  - Kelvin Cusack
    - Filling in for John from his org
  - John Andersen
    - Connecting dots between this and OpenSSF
      - Yogesh was excited to see someone from Intel
        - Intel is involved in RATs but not as much here
  - Kiran Karunakaran
    - Microsoft
    - On Kay Williams's team
    - Will likely lead this meeting in the future
- Upcoming Birds of Feather (BoF)
  - You need to register here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vf-EliXByhg5HZfgVbTqZhfaJFCmvMdQuZ4tC-Eq6wg/edit?pli=1#heading=h.214jg0n2xjhp
    - There is registration for remote
  - Problem Statement currently scoped around software
  - We went back to a more scoped problem statement is that we want to form a formal working group in the IETF for SCITT.
  - In order to form it we have to have stuffiest people show interest in the problem space
  - Need problem space and charter so that it's scoped enough that the leadership is confident that the group can make progress
  - The early design proposal for the SCITT transparency service is that the service is content agnostic
  - any kind of metadata could be provided and retrieved
  - SBOMs, Software Test Cases, Hardware BOMs, Test results on other types of products
  - Electronic ballots (Ray, see mailing list), oil, gas, physical goods (U.S. govt.)
  - In order to gain confidence from the leadership at IETF to form the WG we felt it was critical to narrow the scope for now to software
    - Leadership thought scope was too big at first
- Thoughts around scope
  - Charter is focused on software, an attainable goal
  - Once we have a WG we can later broaden the scope via re-chartering
- We will design something that works for hardware and for software
  - We are hanging software window curtains but we are looking at everything
- Software systems interact with everything else
  - Dick Brooks (REA), any manifest could be signed and processes with SCITT
  - It's just metadata, what was issued, how it was issued
    - @dffml: We are encoding system contexts, Alice, into the chain, one place where she will live.
- Opens
  - Open Policy Agent (mentioned in meeting minutes doc future topics)
    - What are your plans / thoughts around Open Policy Agent and encoding policies into SCITT?
      - Policy can be used in two places
        - Policy for what can be put onto register
          - Some registries might constrain themselves for what types of data they allow
      - Policy for someone evaluating the contents of the registry to make discussions for fitness of use
     - REGO also considered as a policy language
       - Perhaps decide on multi
       - This policy discussion will happen in this WG for now, then maybe a sub working group
  - Dick Brooks: Mentions HR4081
    - On topic for what we are 
    - Talked about attestations for devices containing a camera and microphone and is connected to the internet
      - There will need to be an attestation from the device 
        - Dick submitted to local rep to include software attestations as well
      - https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4081
https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4081/text
- Producers and other parties provide content into the system, attestations, claims, recorded into SCITT ledger
- Dick contacted his congress person to ask to add an amendment to HR4081
  - Amendment for smartphone apps to provide a trust score
    - Tie in with OpenSSF metrics database to grab the security of repos involved
  - Dick
    - Proposed amendment I mentioned for HR 4081:
    - "Require smart phone app stores to include a software supply chain trust score for each app". This gives consumers the ability to check trustworthiness before installing an app,
- Ray: think about attestations is different than the transparency ledger
  - Thinks it's a lot to bite off to do both
  - Are there IoT folks that might have more attestation experience we could tap into?
  - Is there a sub-working group focused on device attestations (in response to HR4081)
    - Device attestations could be recorded tin the transparency ledger
    - TCG DICE WG is a target point of engagement (UCAN, CBOR, DID).

      - https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/Device-Identifier-Composition-Engine-Rev69_Public-Review.pdf
      - Looking at hardware actively attesting
      - Microsoft has an Open Source implementation on GitHub
    - This attestation stuff starts to look at real life commerce, Ray thinks it's important to 
- Joshua Lock
  - On software attestations, I have been working on a page for the SLSA website to describe the model we're working with. I can share to the SCITT list once the change is merged.
  - IIRC the SCITT draft standards refer to a 'software attestation" as a "claim", to disambiguate from RATS & TCG attestations
- Remote Attestation and Device Attestation
  - Embraced COSE and CBOR
    - Also in SCITT
    - Hopefully we converge on underlying formats for both in-toto style and remote attestation style attestations
- There are also NIST attestations
- Vuln information mentioned by Kay as possible content inserted into SCITT
  - This is a goal of ours with our CVE Binary Tool engagement
  - We also could encode SBOMs from the systems that built them, we could patch sigstore to insert into a SCITT ledger
