  - GPT-3 but better
  - Flan: grep: EAT me (few days ago in this thread) perfect
    - this engagement fits in with visualization of software stack of pancakes to grow Alice 🥞 (if this works we will hopefully start accelerating quickly, as we accelerate time for her slows)
  - Summary of the following (Alice thread) in the style of a avxrh or whatever paper
  - Concept of open architecture as an IETF RFC: ^
  - Install Flan and associated DFFML overlays within OS DecentrAlice.
  - What is a Large Language Model?
    - LLMs essentially act as intelligent lookup tables where the promt is like the SQL query
  - See gather_inputs call within memory context method, implement prioritizer there (dont try to refactor into dataflow as class first!)

  - > Linked Data on the Web exists in many shapes and forms. Linked Data can be published using plain RDF files in various syntaxes, such as JSON-LD, Turtle, HTML+RDFa, and more. Next to that, different forms of queryable Web interfaces exist, such as SPARQL endpoints and Triple Pattern Fragments (TPF) interfaces. If we want to query Linked Data from the Web, we need to be able to cope with this heterogeneity. Comunica is a quering framework that has been designed to handle different types of Linked Data interfaces in a flexible manner. Its primary goal is executing SPARQL queries over one or more interfaces. Comunica is a meta-query engine Comunica should not be seen as a query engine. Instead, Comunica is a meta query engine using which query engines can be created. It does this by providing a set of modules that can be wired together in a flexible manner. While we provide default configurations of Comunica to easily get started with querying, anyone can configure their own query engine. This fine-tuning of Comunica to suit your own needs, and avoiding the overhead of modules that are not needed.
    - We want to combine this with SCITT

  - Looks like data flow/notebook hybrid! Cool! But closed source APIs is what are available so far.

  - > All are tending to one and the same goal, at least all aspire to the same goal, from the wise man to the lowest murderer, but only by different ways. It is an old truth, but there is this new in it: I cannot go far astray. I saw the truth. I saw and know that men could be beautiful and happy, without losing the capacity to live upon the earth. I will not, I cannot believe that evil is the normal condition of men… I saw the truth, I did not invent it with my mind. I saw, saw, and her living image filled my soul for ever. I saw her in such consummate perfection that I cannot possibly believe that she was not among men. How can I then go astray? … The living image of what I saw will be with me always, and will correct and guide me always. Oh, I am strong and fresh, I can go on, go on, even for a thousand years.

    > And it is so simple… The one thing is — love thy neighbor as thyself — that is the one thing. That is all, nothing else is needed. You will instantly find how to live.
