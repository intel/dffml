  - > Open Source AI + Data
    > 
    > Free and open source development has proven its criticality, popularity, and success as a method for bringing software to the world. As we forge into the next evolution of technology, led by data and AI, we must consider how to best apply the lessons of free and open source principles, governance, and development and vendor-neutral collaboration. The focus will no longer be on the underlying code, but about data and how we use and appropriately protect it. We’ve already seen many successes in open data, but there’s still much to do and growth to plan for. The open data ecosystem is vast, including models, tools, and of course, the data itself and how it is acquired, stored, trained, and used. Then, to come full circle, AI-powered tools are changing how software is written. What do licenses for data and models look like? Whose ethics become the ethics of the AI systems we will all eventually depend on? What are the coming security and privacy concerns? Will the systems of governance we understand in open source software change around AI projects?
