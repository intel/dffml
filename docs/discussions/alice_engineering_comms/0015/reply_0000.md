  - [ ] `alice shouldi contribute`
    - [ ] Support caching / import / export dataflows
    - [ ] Support query in easy way (graphql)
    - [ ] Support joining with previous runs / more sets of data
  - [ ] Contribute the data OpenSSF cares about to their DB via applicable joins and queries

- TODO
  - [ ] Organization
    - [ ] Daily addition by Alice to engineering log following template
      - [ ] Addition of old TODOs yesterday's logs
  - [ ] Export end state of input network / dump everything used by orchestrator
    - [ ] pickle
    - [ ] JSON
  - [ ] Ensure import works (check for state reset in `__aenter__()`, we probably need a generic wrapper to save the memory ones which populates after the `__aenter__()` of the wrapped object.
  - [ ] GraphQl query of cached state using strawberry library or something like that
  - [ ] Example docs for how to run a flow, then merge with static data as the start state for the cache and then query the whole bit with graphql
- TODO
  - [x] Splice out Code of Conduct contribution demo from July progress report video
  - [x] Add PR and reference PR as example in tutorial along with spliced out `alice please contribute recommended community standards` contribution demo clip
