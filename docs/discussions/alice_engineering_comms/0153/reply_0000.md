    - Mentions pubsub (DWN, or our hacky first stab via polling NVDStyle)
      - We should really go with the traceabilty interop wayâ€¦

  - Grafting trust chains for BOM dependency maintinance and security posture analysis for `Rolling Alice: Coach Alice: Cartographer Extraordinaire`
    - Need to finish deptree work
- Python based markdown to HTML via sphinx build

- TODO
  - [ ] Investigate use of overlays with Common Workflow Language

  - [ ] Ephemeral clusters on devcloud
    - Spin k3s clusters within devcloud nodes via `qsub`
      - Deploy GitHub Actions runner controller
      - Deploy harbor
      - Deploy NVDStyle
      - Deploy Stream of Consciousness webhook endpoint using PAT (later GitHub app) to do the transform (via OA or IPVM or DWN hooks?) into `repo_dispatch`
        - See about localhost.run `LoadBalencer`
        - Webhook handlers
          - harbor
            - container push
              - Trigger `workflow_dispatch` by looking in workflows for `workflow_dispatch`-able workflows for `on.push.paths`  
                -  Optionally take allowlist or blocklist given as endpoint configuration or seed input
                - Validate schema is https://github.com/intel/dffml/tree/main/schema/dffml/image/container/build/0.0.1.schema.jso
                - Look in referenced dockerfiles
                  - Build dockerfile style pipdeptree
                    - #596
                  - Dispatch if relavent `FROM` (our FROM rebuild chain)
              - Operation to upload image via boto3 (Digital Ocean Space)
                - Ensure we have restore from the respective cache when we spin other ephemeral clusters for this context (could bootstrap image build infra, build new harbor from old harbor + cache, redeploy)
- Future
  - [ ] KCP for qsub/stat/etc.
    - Validate by creating a stub version of qsub that runs QEMU for first step for local testing
