  - Hash/dict first mentality needs to move to array/list first as primary data structure. Aligns better with XML from OSCAL. Metapathing would work better if treated as nested lists.
    - Challenge is how can we decouple the model from any of the bindings.
    - Metapath is closest to a "native" concept of the structure

  - Going to try to make some networkx graph image from models

      - John: I played with DAGs with networkx and ended up settling on mermaid trying to do something similar a while back. It will be a bit more work but you'll be able to commit the generated mermaid directly into markdown on github for consistently updated docs based on the metaschema.

  - Exclusive choice implementation within jsonschema implementation

- Dave Waltermire
  - Most important thing about IETF group is coming up with a fun acronym
    - https://github.com/ietf-wg-scitt/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture
  - Arrays and maps in Java for metapath operations implemented
    - Haven't implemented dynamic function definition
  - Looking at SARIF based production of validation results
    - Switch to pick the output format
    - SARIF is JSON based, AJ started and Dave will finish producing JSON and SARIF using metaschema
      - https://github.com/usnistgov/metaschema/pull/519
  - Added type system to Java implementation which gives you human readable types for function definitions
  - Dave now working at FedRamp using OSCAL for effectively admission control
    - External constraints, layered in constraints, define them for FedRamp so that they can be validated for that org, (org overlays)
    - Use SARIF output and XML and JSON to define constraint sets and validate tests.
    - Will be open source as part of the FedRamp automation repo
      - Using JEST for early POC
    - This is an end to end example of definition and validation.
      - Goal is for this to be an example for others to build and modify
