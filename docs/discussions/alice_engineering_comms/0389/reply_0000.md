  - S2C2F is a set of practices that as a consumer of an artifact can help you understand how to evaluate provenance. Helps you better understand provenance of things that don't have SLSA attestation and what you should do from a dependency evaluation and trust evaluation perspective to help you understand what you should be doing to satisfy your risk tolerance.
- Isaac Hepworth
  - S2C2F helps define best practices that an org can adopt
  - Control plane doc seeks to map out how pieces help us get to our ideal state
- Chad Kimes
  - SLSA defines a set of trusted build platforms
  - Looking at threat models of build environments
  - What if there is a temporary breach? How do we limit blast radius
  - Build environment

    - Attack vectors
      - Base images / VMs
      - Initialization of containers / VMs
        - Cloud Service Provider (CSP) or VMM attack
      - Control plane
        - CSP
        - Pipeline Orchestrator
      - Cache
    - Attack goals
      - Steal secrets or act on behalf of workflow
      - Tamper with artifacts
- Marcela Melara
  - Trusted Hardware
    - TEE techniques have different attestation capabilities

    - IETF RATS
      - Protocol for remote attestation
      - Attestation flows for SGX and TDX follow RATS
    - Methods for providing integrety

      - For Open Source supply chain integrity checks are usually more important than confidentiality
      - Provide hardening against control plane attacks
    - Proposal for new build environment integrety track

    - This would help with measuring hermeticness
