- https://github.com/ietf-scitt/draft-birkholz-scitt-software-supply-chain-use-cases/pull/17#discussion_r1102974621
- Offline verification use case
  - Preloading to fight Trojan horse attacks (equivalent of cert pinning using transparency logs?)
    - Our TDX/SGX/TPM Verifiable Credentials use case for full offline CI/CD -> logs as auth
- Hannes Tschofenig: We also have our Distributed database append only log
  - SBOM
  - Report of static analysis
  - Identity of the entity inserting is important so we know if we can "trust" the content in the ledger
    - So we know a bit more about what it means if that entity added to that log
      - For example we may have other logs which track our trust in those entities
      - John (not said): With SCITT we can graft our own for 2nd party / 3rd party trust boundaries and offline use cases
  - Let's talk about OpenID Connect
    - John (not said): We like OpenIDVC
      - https://openid.net/openid4vc/
  - OpenID allows us to provide authentication class and methods
    - Can authenticate via AMR, which let's us know what level the ID token was validated to
    - The ACR value allows client to say I would like a certain level of assurance for an auth
  - Cedric Fournet:
    - We aligned on DID because it is even more flexible
  - Raymond Lutz: The functoin of SCITT ot to connect a semantic meaning to what's in the log
    - Who is the "I" that's releasing that semantic concept and linking it to that hash value?
    - How do we link identity to the semantic meaning of an artifact?
    - John (not said): We leverage ActivityPub Extensions for security.txt style
      - `inReplyTo: "$activitypubextensions_thread", content: "https://time.crystals.prophecy.chadig.com/bulk.1.0.0.schema.json"`

  - Dick Brooks: We need to look at policy on insert
    - Each statement might have a set of critiera whcih needs to be validated by an authorized praty before it can be added to a registry
      - John (in chat): Would https://identity.foundation/credential-manifest/#input-evaluation be helpful for facilitating insert policy?
  - Charles Hart: The owner of SCITT has gatekeeper (grep Alice arch/discussion)
    - We need to solve the problem 
- Henk Birkholz: "SCITT instances" are intended to be fueled by "RATS WG output" in the future.
- Steve Lasker: Idenitty helps us give context, main purpose of SCITT is produced or attested to by an ideneitty that you choose to trust
  - John (not said): These identities could also be ephemeral roles whcih are tied to attested compute (aka built from CI/CD and deployed to confidential compute, example: build_images_containers.yml -> #1247 -> Project Amber -> OIDC -> more builds -> SCITT)
- Jon Geater: Strong identity is who made that statement, we don't have to go down complicated identity route to fulfil our mission, if I say something about microsoft
  - Who owns SCITT? This community here owns SCITT, we shoudl define how deep trust relations
  - We are looking to seal a working copy of the arch this week
