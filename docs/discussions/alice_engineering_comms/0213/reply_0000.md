  - [x] Fix python package release workflow
    - [release.yml](https://github.com/srossross/rpmfile/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml)
    - We use rpmfile for scanning binaries from different distros which package using the RPM format
      - #789
      - https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/595
    - We should capture the webhook event from the release upload and play with that to update pinning within downstream CD
      - #906

      - > Has there been any discussion around maintaining forks and tracking the upstreaming of the fixes from the fork into the upstream? Sometimes there are no maintainers around, and a fork is the only way to go. In that case, we'd probably want to reduce the amount of forks waiting around with fixes, we don't want more than one campaign trying to submit the same fix.
        - Funny, this is what got us involved in rpmfile in the first place
      - Our pinning enables us to leverage these forks
