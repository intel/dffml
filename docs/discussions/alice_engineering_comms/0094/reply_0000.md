    - The following quotes are applicable to our DFFML CI/CD setup.
      We care about static analysis results and stuff (`alice shouldi`),
      for example auth of our runners (grep OSS scanning) and artifacts
      to push data to `data.chadig|nahdig.com` and then to the OpenSSF.
      - Ideally our data structures are self identifying and authing (UCAN, ATP, etc.)
      - We still need bridges into existing identity and auth infra

          - The video this was clipped from was linked in the commit message https://github.com/intel/dffml/commit/fc42d5bc756b96c36d14e7f620f9d37bc5e4a7fd
          - Found the previous stream of consciousness aligned with this. I had been meaning to look for it, we'll be back in this train of thought when we get to didme.me "An Image" python implementation.

When End-Users apply to open a banking account online, in most countries, they are required to submit scanned versions of the required documents. These documents are usually issued by different authorities, and are hard to verify in a digital form. A Self-issued OP directly representing the End-User may have access to a greater set of such information for example in the format of Verifiable Credentials, while a traditional OP may not have a business relationship which enables access to such a breadth of information. Self-Issued OPs could aggregate claims from multiple sources, potentially in multiple formats, then release them within a single transaction to a Relying Party. The Relying Party can then verify the authenticity of the information to make the necessary business decisions.

    - > OpenID Connect, a protocol that enables deployment of federated Identity at scale, was built with User-Centricity in mind. The protocol is designed so that the Identity Provider releases the claims about the End-User to the Relying Party after obtaining consent directly from an EndUser. This enables Identity Providers to enforce consent as the lawful basis for the presentation based on the Relying Party’s privacy notice. The protocol also enables two kinds of Identity Providers, those controlled by the End-Users and those provided by the third parties. Now, User-Centricity is evolving to grant the End-Users more control, privacy and portability over their identity information. Using OpenID for Verifiable Credentials protocols, the End-Users can now directly present identity information to the Relying Parties. This empowers the EndUsers to retain more control over the critical decisions when and what information they are sharing. Furthermore, the End-Users’ privacy is preserved since Identity Providers no longer know what activity the End-Users are performing at which Relying Party. End-Users also gain portability of their identity information because it can now be presented to the Relying Parties who do not have a federated relationship with the Credential Issuer. Then the technical details of OpenID4VC are presented, alongside an explanation of certain decision choices that were made, such as why OpenID Connect, and OAuth 2.0 are well-suited as basis for presentation and issuance protocols for verifiable credentials. Finally, the whitepaper concludes by reiterating the importance of making choices for standards that meet certain use-cases in order to realize a globally interoperable verifiable credentials ecosystem. Achieving large-scale adoption of verifiable credentials will be "by Evolution, not by Revolution". The identity community can more swiftly empower people, and government authorities developing identity infrastructure and policies, by adopting standards like OpenID4VC that facilitate convergence and interoperation of existing and emerging standards.

- We're working on fixing the CI right now
  - The vuln serving `NVDStyle` is our base for comms right now (think manifests)
    - https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/main/docs/arch/0008-Manifest.md
    - This is how we will be facilitating Continuous Delivery.
      - Open source projects will implement vuln stream handling, we are
        hopefully piggy backing our `FROM` rebuild chain and so forth on top,
        once again, we're always looking for reliable resilient ubiquitously
        available comms. Reuse, reuse, reuse.

  - > RainSec - PDX Information Security Meetup: RainSec is an informal group of like-minded security professionals who meet to network and discuss topics of interest in a non-work, non-vendor setting. While our target audience is experienced information security professionals, this is a public event open to any interested parties. If you have a friend or colleague who might benefit, please pass an invite along.

  - We should hybridize this with SCITT recpeits returned for the content addresses, let's use SHA384 or something stronger
  - https://mastodon.online/@rjh/109388812626470845
    - Let's use this hybrid with the NVDStyle API, or perhaps let's wait (8 minutes ago, Chaos smiles on us again ;) Really we should stick with OCI registry on our first pass here.
      - > Work on version 2 of nsrllookup is well underway. When I originally developed it, I elected to write my own very simple wire protocol. Although it still works fine, it means whenever I want to write a binding for a new programming language I have to rewrite the parser-generator.
        >
        > Version 2, currently underway, moves to gRPC.  This should make it much easier to integrate with third-party tools like Autopsy.
