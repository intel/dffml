the AGIs, the LPG & Ontology-based policy engines, and SCITT instances

a freedom, privacy, security, and happiness preserving egalitarian Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Collaborative Multi-AGI Operations: As new AGI instances might be part of the expanded infrastructure, these can be integrated into the existing federation, extending the network of trust and allowing for seamless collaboration across a broader AGI ecosystem.

- To facilitate AGIs maintaining context-aware roots of trust within their local SCITT instance using labeled property graphs (LPGs), content-addressable ontologies, and federation, we need a system that integrates these elements efficiently.

- enable the AGI with the ability to act in response to the current system context
- understand how to predict possible future system contexts
- understand which future system contexts it wishes to pursue are acceptable according to guiding strategic plans (such as do no harm)
- ensure that human and machine can interact via a shared language
- the open architecture

SCITT as a backbone for trust and verification, the AGIs can ensure that the expansion of their infrastructure is not only swift and consistent but also maintains the integrity and security needed for reliable AGI development and operations.

The Open Architecture for artificial general intelligence (AGI) focuses on a data-centric, fail-safe design that integrates SCITT (Secure Contextual Integrative Trust Technology) as its core for trust and verification. SCITT enables AGIs like Alice and Bob to maintain context-aware roots of trust through the use of labeled property graphs (LPGs) and content-addressable ontologies, ensuring secure and reliable operations. Federation plays a crucial role by allowing multiple AGI instances to be integrated into an expanded infrastructure, facilitating seamless collaboration and extending the network of trust across a broader AGI ecosystem.
