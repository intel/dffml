Deploying with the HTTP Service
===============================

In this tutorial we will deploy a dataflow(ffmpeg dataflow) which converts a video to gif over an HTTP service. We'll
also see how to deploy the same in a docker container. Finally in :ref:`usage_ffmpeg_deploy_serve`
we'll setup another HTTP service which waits on GitHub webhooks to rebuilt and deploy the ffmpeg dataflow.

.. note::

    All the code for this example is located under the
    `examples/ffmpeg <https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/master/examples/ffmpeg/>`_
    directory of the DFFML source code.

We'll be using additional plugins from dffml, ``dffml-yaml-config`` and ``dffml-http-service``.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install dffml-yaml-config dffml-http-service

Writing the function
--------------------
We'll first write the function to convert videos files to gif by calling
``ffmpeg`` (Make sure you `download and install <https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html>`_ it) in
``operation.py``. The function accepts bytes (of the video), converts it to gif and outputs it as
bytes.


**operations.py**

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/ffmpeg/operations.py

Dataflow and Config files
-------------------------

DFFML can create a dataflow out of our python function.

.. code-block:: console

    $ dffml dataflow create -config yaml operations:convert_to_gif get_single \
        -seed 480=operations.convert_to_gif.inputs.resolution \
        "['operations.convert_to_gif.outputs.result']=get_single_spec" \
         > deploy/df/ffmpeg.yaml

Here through the seed argument, we set the default resolution to 480 and output
of the dataflow to result of `convert_to_gif`.

Create the config file for the HTTP service
in ``deploy/mc/http/ffmpeg.yaml``

.. code-block:: console

    $ cat > ./deploy/mc/http/ffmpeg.yaml <<EOF
    path: /ffmpeg
    input_mode: bytes:operations.convert_to_gif.inputs.input_file
    output_mode: bytes:image/gif:post_input."operations.convert_to_gif.outputs.result".output_file
    EOF

- ``input_mode``

    - ``bytes:operations.convert_to_gif.inputs.input_file``

        - We want the input from the request to be treated as bytes with definition ``operations.convert_to_gif.inputs.input_file``.


- ``output_mode``

    - ``bytes:image/gif:post_input."operations.convert_to_gif.outputs.result".output_file``

        - We want the response (content_type = image/gif) to be bytes taken from  ``results["post_input"]["operations.convert_to_gif.outputs.result"][output_file]``,
          where ``results`` is the output of the dataflow.

For more details see `HttpChannelConfig <../../plugins/service/http/dataflow.html#HttpChannelConfig>`__ .

.. _usage_ffmpeg_deploy_serve:

Serving the DataFlow
--------------------

Serving the dataflow on port 8080

.. code-block:: console

    $ dffml service http server -insecure -mc-config deploy -port 8080

.. warning::

    The ``-insecure`` flag is only being used here to speed up this
    tutorial. See documentation on HTTP API
    :doc:`/plugins/service/http/security` for more information.

Now from another terminal, we can send post requests to the dataflow running at this port.

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -v --request POST --data-binary @input.mp4 http://localhost:8080/ffmpeg -o output.gif

You should replace ``input.mp4`` with path to your video file and ``output.gif`` to where you want the converted gif
to be output to. An example video is available `here <https://github.com/intel/dffml/raw/master/examples/ffmpeg/input.mp4>`_ .

Deploying via container
=======================

**Dockerfile**

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/ffmpeg/Dockerfile

.. note::

    The run command in the comment section of the Dockerfile will be used to execute
    the container after receving webhooks, so make sure you change it to your usecase.

For this tutorial we will set it to

.. code-block:: Dockerfile

    # docker run --rm -ti -p 8080:8080 $USER/ffmpeg -mc-config deploy -insecure -log debug

.. note::

    The image built after pulling the contaier will be taged ``USERNAME/REPONAME``, where USERNAME and REPONAME
    are gathered from the github html url, received in the webhook.

We can run the container and sent a post request to verify that the container is working.

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker build -t $USER/ffmpeg .
    $ docker run --rm -ti -p 8080:8080 $USER/ffmpeg -mc-config deploy -insecure -log debug

Now in another terminal

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -v --request POST --data-binary @input.mp4 http://localhost:8080/ffmpeg -o output.gif

Now in :ref:`usage_webhook` we'll setup this container to be automatically redeployed
whenever we push to the Git repo containing this code.
