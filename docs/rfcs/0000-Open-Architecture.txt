      Open Architecture: Methodology for interpreting directed graphs as
                          any system architecture

Abstract

   This document describes the Open Architecture, aka Alice; a proxy format
   for domain specific representations of architecture.

   The Open Architecture is a methodology for intepretation of exisitng
   well established, formats, protocols, and other domain specific
   representations of architecture. We define a methodology for interpreting
   a directed graph representing a system architecture.

   We provide implementations which interpret those graphs as software and hardware
   architectures.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft will be submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   This draft will expire on June 1st, 2023.

1.  Introduction

   The Open Architecture enables hybrid on/off chain smart contacts.
   It does this by incorporating risk management into architecture definition /
   smart contract. Smart contracts with understanding of risk are effectively
   entities making decisions based on models. This allows for mutation in
   implementation while maintaining principles.

   The smart contract is able to make its own decisions based on learned
   experience so as to continue to operate until its strategic goals are meet.
   As measured by oracle data ordained from trusted parties as is
   applicable to context. Where chains of trust are established via Peer DIDs
   between entities and data for provenance. Leveraging verifiable credentials
   for review system to measure risk in absence of attestation.
